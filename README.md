We want to understand better just what it is that we're doing! The goal of this "syllabus" is to identify some key themes that drive Data Together as a project & as a politics, and to find some readings that help us understand those themes better.

Once a month on **Tuesday afternoon** we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one of [six themes](#themes) over summer 2018. Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to facilitate discussion.

From this initial iteration, our hope is that the following outcomes occur: first, we learn together! second, through documenting the discussion we understand Data Together principles and see opportunities to feed into ongoing other initiatives and projects

## Themes  

- [A view on the decentralized (distributed) web](#a-view-on-the-decentralized-distributed-web) (June 26)
- [Ownership](#ownership) (July 24)
- [Commons](#commons) (August 21)
- [Centralization as opposed to Decentralization (and peer-to-peer, federation)](#centralization-vs-decentralization-and-peer-to-peer-federation) (September 4)
- [Privacy](#privacy) (September 25)
- [Justice](#justice) (October 30)

## Sessions

### A view on the decentralized (distributed) web

Just getting us all on the same page about this very, err... central question, and also working through distinctions between similar terms (especially) decentralized, distributed, federated, p2p.

**Readings**:

- Brewster Kahle (2015) ["Locking the Web Open, a Call for a Distributed Web"](http://brewster.kahle.org/2015/04/22/locking-the-web-open-a-call-for-a-distributed-web/)

### Ownership

Sometimes when we talk about Data Together we use phrases like "communities taking ownership of their data". What do we mean, and why is this language important to us?

How should we think about "ownership" as a value, and in what ways are individual and collective ownership different from each other?

**Readings**:

### Commons

Sometimes, instead of ownership, we talk about a "commons". How ought the commons to be governed, and by whom?

**Readings**:

### Centralization vs. Decentralization (and Peer-to-peer, Federation)

Now that we've thought more about possession and ownership let's return to thinking about just how decentralization differs from centralizations (and whether or how peer-to-peer or federation fit in)!

**Readings**:

- Nathan Schneider (2017) "The Irresistible Power of Decentralization"‚Äîand Its Elusiveness (DRAFT--not for circulation)
- Executive Summary (6 pages) of [Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization: Back to the Future?](https://dci.mit.edu/research/the-decentralized-web)
-  _See also_: [Beyond distributed and decentralized: what is a federated network? Networked Cultures](https://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/resources/articles/what-is-a-federated-network/)
-  _See also_: P2P Foundation wiki entry on [Peer_to_Peer](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_to_Peer)

### Privacy

Lately we've been hearing some interesting critiques of "privacy as a concept and moral imperative". Let's see if we think they hame sense.

**Readings**:

- [Lepore, Jill Privacy in an Age of Publicity](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2013/06/24/the-prism)
- Wendy Chun Talk, Right to Loiter [Mumbai women assert their right to loiter](http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/Mumbai-women-assert-their-right-to-loiter/article16898193.ece)

### Justice

What is right matters, why go to justice (rather than...), what is fair is discernable (there is something wrong) (Social Justice, Environmental Justice, Data Justice, Design Justice)

**Readings**:

- [Digital Justice](http://detroitdjc.org/principles/), [Design Justice](http://designjusticenetwork.org/network-principles/) principles
- Public Lab [Re-imagining the Data Lifecycle](https://publiclab.org/notes/warren/07-01-2014/reimagining-the-data-lifecycle)
- Data Together Geo Article (?)
