Data. Together. Let's read about it
====

Data Together's reading group is a set of conversations on themes relevant to information and ethics.

*See **blog posts** of previous conversations at [datatogether.org's blog](//datatogether.org/posts/). [Previous semesters' **syllabi**](//datatogether.org/readings/) are also available.*

## Logistics
Once a month, we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one of our [themes](#themes). Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to [facilitate discussion](#facilitation).

üìÖ During session, we meet once a month at 17:30-19:00 ET on a Tuesday ([**Data Together Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u75o4fbnv59006peo07nv67vsg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto))

### (Content) Moderation and Consent
**April 7**

This topic covers factors that impact the content that we see. How do platforms balance freedom of expression versus consent to avoid offensive content, navigate algorithmic versus human moderation and curation, or incentivize different types of interaction? What are downstream effects of these choices?

**Readings:**
[Suggest readings for this topic here!](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/73) The topic's facilitators will then curate final reading selections & distribute at least one month before the discussion.

### Data Monopolies
**May 5**

Most of our data and information is controlled by a handful of companies. How did this come to be, what are examples of responsible and irresponsible holding of this power, and how do we imagine we might slip the trap of data monopolies?

**Readings:**
[Suggest readings for this topic here!](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/75) The topic's facilitators will then curate final reading selections & distribute at least one month before the discussion.

### Trust (Cryptographic and Human)
**June 2**

New technologies attempt to free us from (data) monopolized spaces, but does cryptographic trust truly map onto or enable better human-to-human (or human-to-company or human-to-technology) trust?

**Readings:**
[Suggest readings for this topic here!](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/74) The topic's facilitators will then curate final reading selections & distribute at least one month before the discussion.

### Private Data & Policies
**July 7**

How have particular implementations of data privacy policies impacted humans, economics, and legal systems? What are appropriate expectations around data privacy, and who should inform, create, or enforce policies?

**Readings:**
[Suggest readings for this topic here!](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/76) The topic's facilitators will then curate final reading selections & distribute at least one month before the discussion.

## Facilitation

Here are some guidelines about preparation in order to facilitate a session:

- Before the session:
  - Have read and thought about the texts
  - Identify and write 2-4 "themes" or questions you are interested in from the readings
  - We use the same [shared notepad](https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#): https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#, which uses [a template for notes](./notes/template.md)
- During the session:
  - Arrive on time (call should auto record as the first person enters)
  - Ensure the call is recorded (it should auto-record as the first person enters, but always make sure someone presses the record button if not)
  - Ask for someone to take notes
  - Keep time and gently wrap us up
- After the session:
  - Copy the notes and open a pull request in [this repository](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/tree/master/notes)

## Potential Readings

We maintain a shared bibliography in the [`datatogether` Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2250068/datatogether), which includes potential readings. 

Anyone can request an invite on a call or by [creating a github issue](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/new) in this repository with their Zotero username.
