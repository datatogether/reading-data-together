Data. Together. Let's read about it
====

Data Together's reading group is a set of conversations on themes relevant to information and ethics.

*See **blog posts** of previous conversations at [datatogether.org's blog](//datatogether.org/posts/). [Previous semesters' **syllabi**](//datatogether.org/readings/) are also available.*

## Logistics
Once a month, we'll host a 1.5 hour discussion of one of our [themes](#themes). Everyone should try hard to read the *core* reading (~30 pages), and once or twice sign up to [facilitate discussion](#facilitation).

üìÖ During session, we meet once a month at 17:30-19:00 ET on a Tuesday ([**Data Together Calendar**](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=u75o4fbnv59006peo07nv67vsg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FToronto))

## Facilitation

Here are some guidelines about preparation in order to facilitate a session:

- Before the session:
  - Have read and thought about the texts
  - Identify and write 2-4 "themes" or questions you are interested in from the readings
  - We use the same [shared notepad](https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#): https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw#, which uses [a template for notes](./notes/template.md)
- During the session:
  - Arrive on time (call should auto record as the first person enters)
  - Ensure the call is recorded (it should auto-record as the first person enters, but always make sure someone presses the record button if not)
  - Ask for someone to take notes
  - Keep time and gently wrap us up
- After the session:
  - Copy the notes and open a pull request in [this repository](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/tree/master/notes)

## Potential Readings

We maintain a shared bibliography in the [`datatogether` Zotero group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2250068/datatogether), which includes potential readings. 

Anyone can request an invite on a call or by [creating a github issue](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/new) in this repository with their Zotero username.
