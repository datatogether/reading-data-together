## Data Monopolies (May 12)

[ðŸŽ¬ **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/9RovyYAuPds)

## Intro
Most of our data and information is controlled by a handful of companies. How did this come to be, what are examples of responsible and irresponsible holding of this power, and how do we imagine we might slip the trap of data monopolies?

## Themes
* Anti competitiveness, and how did we get here?

* What are the things we worry about with monopolies?
* Data Monopolies in a COVID era?
* Can data monopolies be a force for good?
* Monopoly vs centralization

## Notes
* Pure consumption vs what bads result from monopolies
* Value of innovation: end in itself vs to the end of reduced consumer prices. What do we measure?
* We care because we believe in some moral harm
* The existence of antitrust laws is an admission that we don't think unbridled capitalism is a good
* Failure to "price in" certain problems/existence of externalities
* Bezos masterful on getting around current concept of monopoly
* What exactly is a data monopoly?
* Market position around data services around which an entity has full control
* Role of open source?
* This is not a pricing issue, this is a power issue. And how is that power leveraged?
* Monopoly from what context? User context, regulatory context?
* Is it a monopoly, or is it an economy of scale? E.g. apple has an economy of scale, they're hard to compete with but you can.
* Monopoly: when an actor in a market uses position to diminish competition
* In what contexts is a data reservoir a pure power aggregator which precludes the formation of alternatives
* Data is a resource; the market is publicity
* Economic framing perhaps unhelpful. Problem that matters the most is the holding of power that by nature continues to concentrate
