# Data. Together. Let's read about it

## Data Monopolies (May 12)

[üé¨ **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/9RovyYAuPds)

## Intro
Most of our data and information is controlled by a handful of companies. How did this come to be, what are examples of responsible and irresponsible holding of this power, and how do we imagine we might slip the trap of data monopolies?

## Themes
* Anti competitiveness, and how did we get here? 
* Anti trust in the EU/US
* What are the things we worry about with monopolies?
* Data Monopolies in a COVID era?
* Can data monopolies be a force for good?
* Monopoly vs centralization
* Impact on freedom


## Notes
* Pure consumption vs what bads result from monopolies
* Value of innovation: end in itself vs to the end of reduced consumer prices. What do we measure?
* We care because we believe in some moral harm
* The existence of antitrust laws is an admission that we don't think unbridled capitalism is a good
* Failure to "price in" certain problems/existence of externalities
* Bezos masterful on getting around current concept of monopoly
* What exactly is a data monopoly?
* Market position around data services around which an entity has full control
* Role of open source?
* This is not a pricing issue, this is a power issue. And how is that power leveraged?
* Monopoly from what context? User context, regulatory context?
* Is it a monopoly, or is it an economy of scale? E.g. apple has an economy of scale, they're hard to compete with but you can.
* Monopoly: when an actor in a market uses position to diminish competition
* In what contexts is a data reservoir a pure power aggregator which precludes the formation of alternatives
* Data is a resource; the market is publicity
* Economic framing perhaps unhelpful. Problem that matters the most is the holding of power that by nature continues to concentrate

00:23:03	maceo.mercey:	I htink you start is good
00:23:40	Kelsey Breseman:	Apparently it was Bork who did that? Or at least that‚Äôs what Goliath suggested
00:25:13	Kelsey Breseman:	this is the key article for that https://www.newyorker.com/business/adam-davidson/teddy-roosevelt-wouldnt-understand-the-eus-antitrust-fine-against-google
00:28:17	Kelsey Breseman:	I like it bc it‚Äôs two potentially valid takes
00:34:20	Kelsey Breseman:	lol just read The Shock Doctrine in which Klein gives a litany of all the places Friedman‚Äôs thought has caused massive harm
00:34:33	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	omg that book
00:34:41	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	pinochet
00:37:36	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	oOooOOOOOoooo
00:37:37	Kelsey Breseman:	good question
00:39:26	Jonathan Victor:	https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/
00:39:31	Jonathan Victor:	(Not in the reading)
00:43:11	Kelsey Breseman:	for varying connotations of ‚Äúamazing"
00:43:25	Kelsey Breseman:	was wondering if that would come up
00:45:47	maceo.mercey:	for me the issue is: in what contexts is a data reservoir a pure power aggregator which precludes the formation of alternatives -- and I personally care less about what happens in the market than what happens in other parts of our lives.
00:46:33	Kelsey Breseman:	‚ÄúPeople You May Know"?
00:46:51	maceo.mercey:	so you are the source of truth about yourself, and that means fb can never have a monopoly?
00:47:06	Peter Abrahamsen:	data as commodity -- Facebook data isn't a commodity
00:47:10	maceo.mercey:	peter did you have a hand up?
00:47:15	Peter Abrahamsen:	meh
00:47:45	Kelsey Breseman:	how ‚Äòbout Google+
00:47:52	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	to me, that‚Äôs an ‚Äúdataset of scale"
00:48:37	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	totally, the ‚Äúright to be forgotten"
00:52:05	maceo.mercey:	I think that's a real questin.  I wonder too.  Maybe we need better examples
00:52:38	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	chronological tweets plz
00:53:13	maceo.mercey:	b5 you next
00:53:17	maceo.mercey:	and kelsey
00:53:54	maceo.mercey:	credit score seems like a really good examle to me.  
00:53:57	Kelsey Breseman:	want to revisit centralization vs monopoly (esp in gvt context)
00:54:20	Peter Abrahamsen:	what market is being monopolized in the case of credit scores?
00:54:30	Peter Abrahamsen:	or social security numbers
00:54:31	maceo.mercey:	so maybe a good question is: why do we tolerate the ssn monopoly? 
00:54:42	Kelsey Breseman:	define ‚Äúwe‚Äù
00:55:52	maceo.mercey:	and "facebook is terrible" may be better grounded in other features, many of them easily enumerable.
00:57:23	Peter Abrahamsen:	data is a resource; the market is publicity
00:57:37	Kelsey Breseman:	oo I want to hear that expanded ^
00:59:34	maceo.mercey:	b5 has a hand
01:00:58	maceo.mercey:	so now we're getting closer to dweb style arguments.  source of truth
01:01:05	Kelsey Breseman:	I‚Äôd say gvt is not a monopoly bc their mandate is to serve the people &&! they are accountable to democratic election, unlike a company
01:01:48	Kelsey Breseman:	to the extent we believe that‚Äôs true, SSN monopoly is fine yeah?
01:01:57	maceo.mercey:	i disagree -- govt's have monopolostic power overe.g. violence.  that claim to authority is central to the operation of the state.
01:02:13	Kelsey Breseman:	^
01:02:40	maceo.mercey:	freedom of hte indivudual and the *social good* maybe
01:02:48	Kelsey Breseman:	for the greater good
01:03:30	maceo.mercey:	we're in a crazy moment.
01:04:04	Kelsey Breseman:	sounds like what Matt‚Äôs saying in chat a bit tbh
01:09:57	maceo.mercey:	brendan has to put a quarter i nthe swearing jar
01:10:10	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	HAh!
01:10:13	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	I will
01:11:21	maceo.mercey:	so why do we call that monopoly?
01:13:10	Kelsey Breseman:	I mean, they bought all these other companies
01:13:12	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	google is infamously short on info about your social graph
01:15:31	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	jonathan we don‚Äôt have a good way to get your hand
01:15:35	Kelsey Breseman:	free/‚Äúfree‚Äù
01:15:35	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	(if you have a thought)
01:15:42	maceo.mercey:	yes I was thinking tht too. 
01:16:19	Kelsey Breseman:	ha well otherwise we‚Äôre just talking about decentralization again
01:17:34	Kelsey Breseman:	the ‚Äúcan you walk away from it‚Äù metric?
01:18:31	Kelsey Breseman:	comes back to Obfuscation: A User‚Äôs Guide to Privacy and Protest
01:19:48	maceo.mercey:	that's cause apple is such a great affective manipulator
01:20:09	maceo.mercey:	so you don't feel owned, maybe
01:20:15	Peter Abrahamsen:	I trust Apple more than Google or Facebook, because I feel I understand their motivations better
01:21:51	Kelsey Breseman:	is this like why you‚Äôre not supposed to let a guy buy your dinner
01:22:01	maceo.mercey:	^ I hink so
01:22:58	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	literally, what does facebook even do
01:23:01	Kelsey Breseman:	tbh it‚Äôs not that good
01:23:20	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	you can geotarget on facebook for $1000
01:24:49	Peter Abrahamsen:	incompetence shouldnt' be reassuring
01:25:02	Kelsey Breseman:	https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/45029192-a-human-algorithm
01:25:23	b5 | Brendan O'Brien:	I‚Äôm thinking a lot about the right to be forgotten
01:26:47	Kelsey Breseman:	the growing sense that we can be easily manipulated
01:27:42	maceo.mercey:	the squirrels under my roof are massing troops and tanks and preparing an invasion of my room. 
01:27:50	maceo.mercey:	it's distracting
01:28:07	Peter Abrahamsen:	invite them in, it'll be adorable
01:28:26	Kelsey Breseman:	also it feels like we‚Äôve been letting all this stuff be tracked forever but ‚Ä¶ smartphones were post-2000, that‚Äôs not v long ago for us to know much
01:29:02	Kelsey Breseman:	the right to accidental forgiveness
01:29:20	maceo.mercey:	it's not just culture, right? it's part of what makes action possible.  ty cataloging every bad thing you did, then seeify ou cna wake up and getout of bed he next mrning. 
01:30:08	maceo.mercey:	I'm gonna have to go right at 7 my time
01:30:09	maceo.mercey:	4 yrs
