# Data. Together. Let's read about it

## Algorithmic Racism & Environmental Data Justice (March 17)

[üé¨ **Recorded Call**]()

### Intro
These selections mostly come from the environmental data justice (EDJ) Syllabus, which has been an evolving document of literature and links to organizations that work in the environmental and data justice spheres. Members of EDGI have preliminarily defined EDJ as "public accessibility and continuity of environmental data and research, supported by networked open-source data infrastructure that can be modified, adapted, and supported by local communities" (Dillon et al. 2017). 

A lot of the readings do not necessarily have to do with environmental data, but are the data justice offerings that influenced EDGI's EDJ as working group. The first is Sasha Constanza-Chock's essay on Design Justice, which is now a book! Then, we are reading the FAIR and CARE principles that the Indigenous Sovereignty Networks have developed. Finally, Pollution is Colonialism is a short but eye opening blogpost.These works have influenced the academic article of the bunch, "When data justice and environmental justice meet: formulating a response to extractive logic through environmental data justice."

### Themes

#### All of these works surface themes:
* Interlocking powers of oppression as they shape and contain data
* Extractive logic by which we produce and use data
* Community-centered data practices
* Activism for better data

#### Key Points from Readings

##### EDJ Syllabus
* Most of these readings are on the EDJ syllabus. I encourage everyone to explore it and if any of the themes in the readings stick out to you, you can find more on them here. There is a more elaborate DJ section. I still have to put up the FAIR and CARE principles.
* We aim to develop the EDJ syllabus as a collaborative and ever-changing document. If you want to add something, please do.

##### Pollution is Colonialism

* Land is at the center of colonialism
    * Value comes from the extraction of resources and people from land.
* Pollutants are material forms of harm
    * Pollutants pose health hazards to land and bodies.
* The state gives permission to pollute
    * Industry gets permits to pollute certain amounts of compounds without the consent of people. 
* Call to action
    * List of relevant activist organizations

##### CARE Principles

###### **C**ollective Benefit
Indigenous peoples should benefit from data infrastructure design and functions. This design process should promote the self-determination of communities and meet their needs. Moreover, communities should be engaged in determining data policies.
###### **A**uthority to Control
Data should recognize indigenous peoples‚Äô self-determination and self-governance. Data policies and protocols should recognize both collective and individual rights to free, prior, and informed consent
###### **R**esponsibility
Researchers working with Indigenous data are responsible for showing how it relates to Indigenous Peoples‚Äô self-determination and collective benefit. Relationships between communities and data stewards should encourage transparency, trust, respect, reciprocity, mutual understanding. They should focus on expanding capability and capacity while enhancing data literacy. Resources should generate data that pertain to the languages, worldviews, values, and principles of indigenous peoples.
###### **E**thics
Data collection and practices across the data lifecycle should align with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and ethical assessments of benefits and harms should be conducted from the perspectives of those relating to the data. These ethical considerations should be geared towards future use and metadata data acknowledging data provenance and study the limits or obligations

##### FAIR Principles
###### **F**indable
* (Meta)data is rich and contains an identifier that is clearly described. They are registered and indexed.
* Question: what about anonymous data? How much work is it to index (meta)data?
###### **A**ccessible
* (Meta)data are retrievable, and the protocol for this process is open and authenticated.
* Archiving of metadata is important to ensure accessibility
###### **I**nteroperable 
* (Meta)data are accessible and use "broadly applicable language"
* "use vocabularies following FAIR principles"
* Reference to other (meta)data (everything is linked!)
###### **R**eusable 
* Rich, accurate descriptions and detailed provenance. Community standards are important for (meta)data.

##### Design Justice
* New book out!  https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/design-justice
* The matrix of domination - interlocking structures of oppression including but not limited to racism, ableism, heteropatriarchy, capitalism, etc. inform most top-down design practices.
* Alternative design of systems, infrastructure, and information can center marginalized perspectives by involving communities in a bottom-up approach.
* Organizations like Detroit Digital Justice and Allied Media are moving towards this approach towards design for collective liberation and sustainability.

##### Extractive Logic
* Bridging from Design Justice and Black feminism, we explore how data is tied up in the Matrix of Domination. Environmental data both serves and can be used to challenge the matrix of domination.
* Can justice ever be achieved? Maybe not, but we are working towards it.
* Has an informative overview of EJ vs. DJ. Both deal with extraction and accumulation of capital to the disadvantage of historically marginalized people.
* ‚ÄòExtractive logic‚Äô
    * the accumulation of resources, like data, for capital gain by those in power. Connects with Pollution is colonialism.
* disconnects data from provenance
    * erased the source of data and the people/ power relations that extracted it.
* privileges the matrix of domination
    * Certain people can see/create/use/access data over others.
* whitewashes data to generate uncertainty
    * ECHO and TRI present themselves as authoritative data sources but are really industry self-reported and not easy to use databases.
* EDGI's public comment
* We struggled to get these ideas across to a policy audience.
