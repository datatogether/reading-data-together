# Data. Together. Let's read about it

## Private Data & Policies (May 12)

[🎬 **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/Qiw-WKBQ8A4)

## Intro
How have particular implementations of data privacy policies impacted humans, economics, and legal systems? What are appropriate expectations around data privacy, and who should inform, create, or enforce policies?

## Themes
- Intersections with Trust conversation: does it make sense to apply the concept of trust to a corporation? and other questions
- Intersections with Monopolies and Consent conversations: does "consent" really apply in situations where you have to click "ok" to access the one service you need?
- Feasibility & implementation vs principles (esp with respect to GDPR reading)
- Intersections with algorithmic racism: how do our policy choices (wrt protection of private data) potentially enable unintentional algorithmic racism


## Notes
### Grounding
* Brookman & Hans, Center for Democracy & Technology (2013) [Why Collection Matters: Surveillance as a De Facto Privacy Harm](https://cdt.org/insights/report-why-collection-matters-surveillance-as-a-de-facto-privacy-harm/) on why data collection matters
    * > In terms of privacy protection, some theorists have insisted that advocates must articulate a concrete harm as a prerequisite for legislated rules
    * > Others have argued that privacy protections should focus exclusively on curtailing controversial uses rather than on the collection of personal information.
    * > This paper argues that consumers have a legitimate interest in the mere collection of data by third parties. That is, big data collection practices per se, rather than bad uses or outcomes, are sufficient to trigger an individual’s privacy interests.

2)  Internal Misuse
3)  Unwanted Secondary Usage and Changes in Company Practices
4)  Government Access
5)  Chilling Effects

    * *Privacy* includes the famous “right to be left alone,” and the ability to share information selectively but not publicly (White House 2014)
    * *Confidentiality* means “preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure, including means for protecting personal privacy and proprietary information” (McCallister, Grance, and Scarfone 2010).
    * > Why confidentality important
        * Promise, ethical, legal, practical implications
    * Attribute, identity, residual (combining to get confidential info) disclosure
    * Notification is either comprehensive or comprehensible, but not both. (Nissenbaum 2011)
    * > Collection and analysis often no longer within same entity. Ownership of data less clear
    * > The challenge in the case of big data is that data sources are often combined, collected for one purpose and used for another and users often have no good understanding of it or how their data will be used. 


### Attempted and proposed solutions

* Sobers, Varonis (a cybersecurity company) (2020) [A Year in the Life of the GDPR: Must-Know Stats and Takeaways](https://www.varonis.com/blog/gdpr-effect-review/) a review of one year of GDPR implementation
    - Changing the landscape of data protection — The GDPR put a large spotlight on data protection and it’s being taken much more seriously across the board.
    - Greater reliance on third parties and data experts — There has been increased hiring around data protection and GDPR law advice.
    - Businesses were overall unprepared — Due to the strict penalties and open-ended nature of the legislation, very few companies felt confident in their level of compliance.
    - Fewer fines have been given than expected — It seems as though this first year has been somewhat of a grace period as everyone continues to adjust their practices.
    - Enforcement agencies overwhelmed with scope — There seem to be staffing shortages that hindered some agencies from keeping up with complaints and notifications.
    - Mixed feelings among consumers
    - Relatively minimal enforcement - seems like the success is largely self reported. 
        - what are we gaining for the cost incurred?
    - Curious that some businesses chose to straight up leave the market
    - Mixed feelings about trust that this has been propely executed. 
    - Notably many of the items that were supposed to be implemented seem quite fuzzy as a standard "wherever possible"

    * Transparency:  Consumers have a right to easily understandable information about privacy and security practices.
    * Respect for Context:  Consumers have a right to expect that organizations will collect, use, and disclose personal data in ways that are consistent with the context in which consumers provide the data.
    * Security:  Consumers have a right to secure and responsible handling of personal data.
    * Access and Accuracy:  Consumers have a right to access and correct personal data in usable formats, in a manner that is appropriate to the sensitivity of the data and the risk of adverse consequences to consumers if the data are inaccurate.
    * Focused Collection:  Consumers have a right to reasonable limits on the personal data that companies collect and retain.
    * Accountability:  Consumers have a right to have personal data handled by companies with appropriate measures in place to assure they adhere to the Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights.

    * Harmonization of data 
    * Base-level privacy policies
    * Standardization across industry of application

    * Information Fiduciary

> Compliance with state legislation and common law—and the threat of class-action suits and actions by state attorneys general—have become sufficiently burdensome that some companies, such as Microsoft, already have indicated that they are open to comprehensive federal privacy legislation that would preempt conflicting state regulation. Congress could respond with a “Digital Millennium Privacy Act” that offers a parallel trade-off to that of the DMCA: accept the federal government’s rules of fair dealing and gain a safe harbor from uncertain legal liability, or stand pat with the status quo.

> The DMPA would provide a predictable level of federal immunity for those companies willing to subscribe to the duties of an information fiduciary and accept a corresponding process to disclose and redress privacy and security violations. As with the DMCA, those companies unwilling to take the leap would be left no worse off than they are today—subject to the tender mercies of state and local governments. But those who accept the deal would gain the consistency and calculability of a single set of nationwide rules. Even without the public giving up on any hard-fought privacy rights recognized by a single state, a company could find that becoming an information fiduciary could be far less burdensome than having to respond to multiple and conflicting state and local obligations.

## Discussion
* JV: really liked first article. Paper tries to frame: why do we care about data privacy? What are by-default risk items? By virtue of how these systems are constructed, you can either assume harm is introduced either when harm occurs, or when the possibility of harm occurs.
* KB: Getting things in under the wire
* JV: risks - tradeoffs. Interesting tension btw minimally regulating vs regulating before the harm occurs. What do we define as PII? How do we make it not so hard for people to implement but functional
* KB: thinking about where we do and don't desire rules/regulations. Interplay with trust.
* JV: What is the sum of the total harm we are avoiding? What is the sum of the total harm we are creating?
* KB: Is that harm distributed in ways that are sensible to compare?
