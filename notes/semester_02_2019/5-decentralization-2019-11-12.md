## Decentralization (November 12, 2019)

[🎬 **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/74jsTUzdOZc)

### Intro
True to form, we gathered readings in a decentralized way. Themes that emerged were: looking critically at how "decentralization" is defined, how it could/should be measured, and the sticky problems that aren't automatically solved (and sometimes are actually caused) by technology. The readings are chunked to break them up a bit. The first 3 focus on decentralized tech and apps, the next 3 on political decentralization, and the last 2 on decentralized knowledge creation and stewardship.

### Notes from readings
1. Sarah Friend. **Decentralization and its Discontents** 
  * 3 guiding q's
    * What is decentralization?
    * Do we want decentralization?
    * Are there limits to decentralization?
  * Defining decentralization: draws from political and then organizational contexts. So what is our context and how is it defined there?
    * We may bring several contexts and several definitions– technical on a protocol basis? Organizational? Archival?
  * Broad range of claimaints to "decentralization"
    * Characterization of a free market as by-nature decentralized– rational actors operating without centralizing system
    * Mao for decentralized socialism: "locally self-completed industrial system"
  * Lorentz curve & Gini coefficient used to measure decentralization of wealth
    * Applied to cryptocurrencies shows intense disparities
  * Why not centralization
    * "Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion."
  * Governance & censorship: "Is there anything such that you would stop participating in the network?"
    * Nazis, child porn, etc.
  * Motives– broad umbrella! So many reasons to be interested
  * "Networks centralize for efficiency and decentralize for resilience"
  * Scalability trilemma
    * Decentralization (can run in small compute env at each user node)
    * Scalability (ability to process transactions efficiently)
    * Security (resources needed by a hacker)
    * "Decentralization is a stat we could lower to improve the other two"
  * Decentralization of manufacturing
    * 3 major RAM producers
    * Tech sensitive to localized natural disasters
  * Connection between centralization and specialization (bus factor!)
  * Process of the developers is not decebtralized, shown by Lorentz curve on open source projects commits per dev [starting here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRS9OW2IXhD3uboF7fDb8aBegEA7MzeqyJpGvoYxithpLYu__cwSyfZhmQj08mJvm1RPtPA6Du3bEeI/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g451e42b6e3_0_41)
  * "Who and what are we serving with our particular decentralization?"
2. Angela Walch. (2019) **Deconstructing 'Decentralization': Exploring the Core Claim of Crypto Systems** 
  * Points of centralization in a mostly-decentralized system
    * Not really decentralized unless all the subsystems are decentralized, e.g. software dev process centralized to small group of developers
    * Concentration of wealth
    * Power of an exchange to include/disinclude
  * Decentralization conceptualized as a tool for disruption & revolution, break up existing power structures
  * Disambiguating "distributed" vs "decentralized": "decentralized" = nodes controlled by different parties, not necessarily true for distributed
  * Insights into decentralization
    * Decentralization is non-binary; it is multifaceted and each facet is on a spectrum
    * Decentralization changes over time
    * Decentralization can be used to hide power
  * Example of Bitcoin centralized decision making: 11 developers knew about a major bug and made a patch & decision to deliberately keep some info about that bug hidden *(Does this show centralization of power? Or could it show decentralization of initiative?)*
    * "..if some things have to be kept secret from others, the system is not decentralized." (19)
    * "moments of crisis uncover where actual power lies in a system"
    * *curious if there's a conflation of coordination with "centralization"*
  
3. Kleppmann, Martin & Wiggins, Adam & Hardenberg, Peter van & McGranaghan, Mark. **Local-first Software**
  * *These principles articulate an ideal more than they do an existing software practice*
  * Local-first means that though info can be on the cloud, your local copy is primary & it's a backup (vs: cloud is primary and yours is a cache)
  * Faster work b/c no need to bounce to remote server
  * Work is not trapped on one device, there's data sync
  * Network is optional to function
  * Collaboration seamless and supportive of varied workflows (e.g. suggest vs direct edit), Google Docs a key example
  * Should be archivable to be legible even if a service is no longer running
  * Privacy and security through end to end encryption: cloud service cannot decrypt
  * You own the data: can access, modify, copy
  
  > With data ownership comes responsibility: maintaining backups or other preventative measures against data loss, protecting against ransomware, and general organizing and managing of file archives. For many professional and creative users, as introduced in the introduction, we believe that the trade-off of more responsibility in exchange for more ownership is desirable. Consider a significant personal creation, such as a PhD thesis or the raw footage of a film. For these you might be willing to take responsibility for storage and backups in order to be certain that your data is safe and fully under your control.

4. Brancati, D. (2006). **Decentralization: Fueling the Fire or Dampening the Flames of Ethnic Conflict and Secessionism?**
  
  * Decentralization to localized gvt a *win* where it increases local participation but *bad* where it highlights differences between regions
    * Win more elections, greater influence on policy
    * Reinforce local identity, produce legislation that favors one group over another
  * Regional vs ethnic parties an important distinction

5. Elinor Ostrom. **Green from the Grassroots**

* Importance of enacting climate change policy at several layers of locality (city/state/federal/international)
  * We need to be able to evolve & adapt bc of high uncertainty
  * Research shows overlapping policies are more effective than a single overarching policy
* 30+ states and over 900 US cities have created plans despite lack of federal plan

6. Rachel-Rose O’Leary. **This North Syrian School Is a Baby Step Toward a Blockchain Society**

> ...North Syria’s governance structure, which consists of communes where people come together to take decisions at a local level. It’s here, Maxmud says, where blockchain can play a unique role. Using a distributed ledger for public accounting, communes can make their spending transparent and better manage collective resources
---

7. James C. Scott. (1998) **Seeing Like a State**

  > Any large social process or event will inevitably be far more complex than the schemata we can devise, prospectively or retrospectively, to map it. (309)
  
  * Importance of "improvisations, missteps, and strokes of luck" for success even in systems where rigid heirarchy is emphasized
  
  > ...the schemes that did not collapse altogether managed to survive thanks largely to desperate measures either not envisaged or else expressly prohibited by the plan." (310)
  
  > Formal order ... is always and to some considerable degree parasitic on informal processes, which the formal scheme does not recognize, without which it could not exist, and which it alone cannot create or maintain.
  
  * Work-to-rule strike: workers perform their tasks exactly according to rules (no improvisations or creativity) and thus productive work ceases
  * This is a reason why authoritarian control is dangerous & unproductive
  * *If we interact primarily in digitally mediated & built-environment spaces, what impact does that have on the availability of creativity? What important improvisations are not possible, given that code **is** a set of rules?*
  
  * Different measurement & classification types: imposed (central) & standard vs. local & useful. e.g. classifying plants by utility rather than genus
  * Practical knowledge derived through experimental solutions to a problem at hand
  * Connection to stewardship: (on derivation of practical knowledge) "these cultivators have a direct, vital stake..." (324)
  * Cases of practice preceding science b/c cause & effect of a local practice can be perceived by a motivated observer even if mechanism is unknown (325)
  
  > Metis ... is the mode of reasoning most appropriate to complex material and uncertain tasks where the uncertainties are so daunting that we must trust our (experienced) intuition and feel our way. (327)
  
  > Where the interactions involve not just the material environment but social interaction as well– building and peopling new villages or cities, organizing a revolutionary seizure of power, or collectivizing agriculture– the mind boggles at the multitude of interactions and uncertainties (as distinct from calculable risks). (327)

  * Advocates a "strategic retreat" from comprehensive planning. More about learning how to learn to build and doing it incrementally
  * Veillees in France: gatherings to swap local knowledge
  * Metis not evenly distributed, intersectional issues where concentrated into guilds, fraternities, etc.
  * Metis disappears as easier, cheaper solutions (e.g. pesticides) become available. This leads to centralized control– e.g. pharmaceuticals that can only be made in a lab via secret formula displace knowledge of natural, distributed, and freely available functional natural remedies
  * Capitalist profit requires efficiency + control (336) (not sure I followed this argument)

8. Jessica J. Prentice. **The Most Dangerous Notion in Reinventing Organizations** 
  
  > contemporary conventional farming as derived from European history can be seen as the predict-and-control approach to food production, whereas permaculture is absolutely about sense-and-respond

  > Holacratic domains function in an analogous way [to usufruct]: *they flow from use, familiarity, need, and negotiation*. Ownership, in this sense, is less an *exclusive possession* than an *explicit and privileged stewardship*.
  
  > In these small communities, where the network of family relationships was so dense and complex, public opinion so important, and social values so deeply ingrained, a strong and visible government was superfluous. (Margolin, "The Ohlone Way")
  
  > ...I believe that the headman received his leadership in the first place through the natural tendency of the members of the tribe to go to the most able member for advice. (Mayfield)
  
  > Another feature of the hunter-gatherer way of life is a deep respect for individual decisions. There are experts rather than leaders, men or women whose skills are revered; but decisions about whether to follow their lead or take their advice are matters of individual choice. (Brody)

## Questions/Themes

## Discussion
**BRENDAN**: Hello, everybody, and welcome. Welcome to the final course in our semester to have our data together reading group. I'm very much looking forward to today's topic, decentralization.

Just a little signposting: we have planned our semester three, we have not set dates for it. But we are now starting to field and collect readings for our next semester, which we'll figure out the dates for it at some point in the future.

The subject for semester three is going to be polity: what does it mean, to be participating in a government?

My name is B5, I'm going to be helping to facilitate a discussion that hopefully I will be stepping forward, giving a little preamble and then stepping back.

The topic of tonight's conversation is decentralization. This is a conversation about a word, a word that has pulled a number of us together over the years, months, minutes.

I think decentralization is very interesting, as far as words go. Decentralization, to me is an angsty teenager. It's this super cool word that refuses to pick a lane. It hangs out with other really cool words like "disrupt", "design", and "open". And clearly, it doesn't fully identify with any of those words it's just adjacent to those words.

Decentralization is this wonderful concept that draws a number of people in.

Tonight we're going to look at decentralization in three major contexts. If we look at our readings, I sort of thought it would be nice to bucket these in the context of technology, groups of people, and the state; and feel free to challenge those.

We've done a number of readings that help frame and set each of those contexts. And because we're here to think critically, I think one of the more interesting things we can do is play those contexts off of each other, looking for insights.

One thing I did want to do as an exercise is, now that you've done some reading on the topic, write down your own quick interpretation or definition of what the word decentralization means for you. We're not going to go around and share it. I don't think we should. I think it'd be more interesting to just write a note to yourself that we'll hopefully review at the end of this.

I'm going to leave a minute, not too long. And I don't want you to think too hard about it, because you've already done the work. So now let's take one minute and just do a definition for decentralization.

How's everybody feeling? more time? Awesome. Kevin.

**KEVIN**: Should we do like a quick round of introductions too?

**BRENDAN**: That sounds like a good idea. Do you want to start, Kevin? And then I can call on them.

**KEVIN**: I'm Kevin, I'm a part of EDGI, the Environmental Data and Governance Initiative. We're one of the partners of the Data Together network. I've been a long term volunteer there for the past two years; and for the past year, the part-time community coordinator. I've been on the email list and sending out messages and stuff like that.

Popcorn style, I pick Matt.

**MATT**: I'm Matt Price. I was involved in EDGI from the very beginning until not that long ago, and I teach at the University of Toronto, and I'm here to talk to people. Oh, I get to pick. How about Kelsey?

**KELSEY**: Hi, I'm Kelsey. I am at EDGI and have been taking the lead on this Data Together initiative for the last year-ish.

But I also think about the decentralized web a lot and I have a meetup going on here in Seattle on the decentralized web. I feel like I've introduced myself to all of you before. So let's move on to Eric.

**ERIC**: Everybody, Eric Nost. I'm involved with EDGI and have been for the past few years, especially on the web monitoring side of things. And I teach at the University of Guelph. I'm going to point at Dawn.

**DAWN**: I'm probably the same intro as Matt's, with a slight variation. I feel like I'm like an emeritus member of EDGI and Data Together. I was around for a long time, but less so lately. I'm a PhD student, that's the difference, at University of Toronto, but I guess I also think about decentralization stuff more broadly than my previous involvement in EDGI and Data Together. It's always been an interesting space where worlds collide.

And I guess I see Mauve.

**MAUVE**: Hello, I'm Mauve. I work at the Dat project. And I'm just interested, I guess, in decentralization in general. Lately, I've been a lot more into community organizing and figuring out how to better facilitate discussions and have more open ways of people collaborating in tech in my community at Dat. And also just figuring out how to get more artists to be using this decentralization tech rather than business types.

I don't know who hasn't spoken. Has Kevin gone?.

**KEVIN**: I'll pick the Stefans. Whoever, whichever Stefan wants to go

**STEFAN**: Is it my turn?

Okay. I'm Stefan. I do a lot of different things in the consulting space right now. I used to work in government for a few years; I used to be in the academic world for a few years too; and now I'm doing a lot of cooperativism with some other consulting colleagues to try and form a cooperative together. So learning a little bit about that, which is pretty exciting.

**BRENDAN**: Fantastic.

**HEATHER**: I'm Heather. Stefan, my partner, had told me about this reading group. And when he described it to me, I got very, very excited because a very, very, very long time ago, I did an MA on culture science and technology.

Also I'm an artist. I have a BFA, and then I got really interested in a lot of different stuff to do with a critical theory of interactive media and philosophy of science and sociological feminist critique of things like reproductive technologies, and then proceeded to go a different way and haven't been thinking about those things for a very long time.

That was over 10 years ago. So now I'm really excited to start thinking about the issues that affect this time in this moment, and this seems like a really great place to do it. So I'm very excited to participate.

**BRENDAN**: Fantastic, thank you so much. This is great.

Thank you, everybody, for joining. For those of you who haven't met me, I'm B5 or Brendan O'Brien. I'm calling from Brooklyn and I'm I work in a project called Qri and we do decentralized open data, built partially on the IPFS, ideally with more decentralized things in the future.

With that, we've all jotted down a quick definition. I really loved the way that the readings were truncated into three major groups. I definitely found that having Sarah Friend's introduction, her ten-minute quick jump in was a great framing for a lot of this conversation, given that she had three questions right out the gates, that help tee off this discussion.

I thought we'd just put that to the group as a starting point: to hear what others' definitions of decentralization is, and if you feel the need to pull in a different reading or pull the discussion in a different direction, feel free.

So for anyone: What does decentralization mean to them?

yeah. Kelsey, then Mauve.

**KELSEY**: I can pull up Sarah's questions:

* What is decentralization?
* Do we want decentralization?
* Are there limits to decentralization?

Brendan, I totally agree that these are the right questions. I feel like we end up asking the first one and not the other two a lot. So I wanted to go into especially critiques of what decentralization is. I don't have a direct answer to "what is decentralization".

**MAUVE**: To me, decentralization is almost like a practice or a look at how power structures end up looking.

One thing that's been on my mind a lot is like, to me, a decentralized group is one where power is bottom up. Individuals ultimately have autonomy. And then they collaborate with others so that they can form consensus and work together, rather than centralization, where you have someone up top, and it's a top-down hierarchy where they have some sort of needs and then they have the others fulfill those needs.

For me, **decentralization is really having power spread up and organizing bottom-up rather than having power concentrated and organizing top down**.

**STEFAN**: Awesome. Dawn.

**DAWN**: I have a textbook definition I lean on: "delegating decision making and authority away from delegating decision making and activities away from a central authority", which is, I think, the abstract way it gets framed in a political context.

I don't know if it is totally right. Or, I don't know if you want to leave it abstract like that when you move it into a technical space.

I really thought these were a cool collision of readings that tried to represent both technical and political sort of sides of the coin.

I remember way back last year when we did "what is decentralization", I think Matt was flagging the genealogy of the term.

That's something that I've been thinking about lately: **Where has decentralization been used?** I think these readings support asking that.

**KELSEY**: One thing I want to highlight about the word decentralization is that **it's defined in opposition**. I think that's really interesting, because I don't think that we have a non-antagonistic word for what we're talking about.

Basically, what it suggests is that there's a tendency to centralize. We're probably familiar with: in power structures, it's really easy to have there be one source of truth, and much harder to have there be several sources of input– and also decision.

It reminds me a lot of some of Rich Bartlett– I think we've read him before in this– has written about decentralized power structures and patterns as it relates to the Enspiral cooperative. He talks about how **they have to actively work to continuously decentralize**. If you're in a decentralized organization, and what that means is that you just don't name someone as a leader, then you end up with people secretly in charge, rather than transparently in charge.

If you want actual decentralization, you need people to say, "Hey, I noticed that I've been accidentally becoming a central node. How do we deconstruct that?"

**HEATHER**: My definition is not different than what other people said. I basically said distributed network whereby power is not top down.

I, like Kelsey, struggled after writing distributed network. And then I tried to think of how to say the next part without negating something else. And that was really hard. And I didn't want to, but it's in the word; decentralized is already a negation.

One of the qualities to me that's interesting about decentralized networks or decentralized knowledge, or decentralized power structures, is that what we have is emergent. Direction, intention and all the things you just described, Kelsey, **who's in charge of something or taking responsibility is an emergent property of a group.**

I think it's ripe for coming up with other words; I think people have probably already worked on this about coming up with a word that's not a negation.

One place that might be really useful to look is pedagogy. I'm an early childhood educator. And also I've taught at university level, but right now, I've been a preschool teacher for a long time. And my interest is in alternative pedagogies, such as Montessori, original, Reggio Emelia, and Waldorf as well. They're very much about emergent learning or inquiry-based learning.

I'm 44. So any of you that are much younger might have already gotten to do this when you were in school, when you were little, but I didn't. And I wish that I had, I think now it's quite common. Maybe there's a lot of language within alternative pedagogies that would be useful for thinking about decentralizing our sense of direction and agency and intention setting.

**BRENDAN**: Stefan, do you want to do a follow-up?

**STEFAN**: My thought when I was trying to define decentralization, I couldn't. I was sitting there not being able to. And but then hearing everybody else talk about it. I thought maybe I would add another layer to thinking about how to define decentralization: an X-Y axis where you have decentralization versus representation.

It seems like with centralization you have the need for more representation, and more opportunities for mediation and media slotting in. And **With decentralization, there's there's more of a need for facilitation, as opposed to representation.**

When I was reading those readings, I was thinking about how a lot of these examples that are upheld as examples of decentralization, in a lot of ways, **it's people governing themselves**.

What that involves and entails is a lot of conversation, a lot of facilitation, a lot of communication. When you see centralization, it's kind of the opposite. There isn't a two-way street between communicators. What's communicated out is broadcast.

Maybe narrowcast is also an interesting dichotomy; to broadcast and narrowcast. We're still in a centralized paradigm, but it's decentralized. So the conversation isn't two-way.

**BRENDAN**: It's very interesting to hear that almost all the initial reactions seem to originate from this political side of things. I'm hearing a lot of like dancing around the phrases power and power distribution

To that end, I think to support something where you were saying Stefan, Sarah has asked us to consider this question of the intersection of intersectional thinking and decentralization in her very quick talk, and this question of how those two things play against each other.

I think that some of what you were saying gets at that questioning of if we can think of decentralization as existing on a spectrum. Can we consider the spectrum? I'm misphrasing her a little bit here, but the general vibe is, do we have to get some of the whole of the spectrum to be able to be able to pull this into our heads properly?

I think it's worth it to try and pull the conversation back towards the technical folks for a little while and put the technical pinning on it. I think a lot of us come to the word decentralization from a political trajectory.

I think when we think about decentralization from a technical side of things, it was really interesting to see Vitalik Buterin say decentralization is three key concepts. It's pretty simple: **compute power, distributed relatively evenly**.

* Does the whole network compute faster?
* Is the whole network able to process more transactions than the sum of its parts effectively?
* And can we make sure that control of the network isn't concentrated in 51% of the people on the network?

That's a very cut and dried definition of decentralization. 

I feel like there's a tension that often exists when we introduce the technology framing to the politics framing where the technologists really want us to interpret the phrase "decentralization" quite specifically. We have decentralization meaning a specific suite of characteristics of a of a network and and the way that it behaves. But the thing that draws a lot of us to this, in my mind, is this political framing: **we're here because we want to have an effect on a method of organizing.**

**KELSEY**: I like the specificity of that technical definition because it's also clearly about power. It's just that the **power is really specifically defined in this network. Because it's code, it's made of rules.**

What's really fascinated me that I cannot resolve in my head: **when we talk about decentralization in terms of social structures, it is almost entirely about increasing individual trust. And when we talk about it in a technical context, it is almost entirely about removing the need for trust through technology**.

There's so much cognitive dissonance in using the same language and thinking about both things in the same conversation. None of the metaphors work.

**MATT**: That's confusing to me, too. It seems to me that one way to, to begin the conversation is: **from what qualities or associations does decentralization acquire a kind of moral authority for people like us?** Why do we think, oh, decentralization good?

It seems to me there's one set of technical arguments about robustness of a network, but then there's a set of political arguments that we've just been describing. They're not all necessarily compatible with each other. There are libertarian and anarchist decentralizers who may have pretty different views about where the good resides. But they share this word.

I doing some of the readings today, I felt guilty of a kind of slippage between the technical and moral/political senses of the term: attributing to the technical features, the moral characteristics of shared power. This, when there's no reason to believe, or at least this was my sense from Deconstructing Decentralization, that there's no need for those technical structures to deconcentrate power.

You can have technically decentralized infrastructure that still concentrates power in a small number of hands. That seemed like a bummer that we should pay attention to.

**MAUVE**: I think Bitcoin and blockchain and The FinTech side of decentralization is an excellent example of decentralization that's super centralized, just like projects end up having centralization hidden underneath.

In the FinTech case, it's actually super obvious where the centralization is, and it's inside money. Since the whole system is geared around, how do I make and how do I keep my money? If you have it, you get more money, and it's a barrier to entry to everyone else. **Even if it's distributed, the power dynamics aren't necessarily decentralized.**

Decentralized is one thing, but then there's also, **is it a distributed system? Is it peer to peer? And then, is there a single implementation?** These are other technical qualifiers that drastically change the way it works.

**ERIC**: I'm not a technical person; that's not where I come at this from, at least at first glance. I'm more on the political end of things. And so when I was asked, What is decentralization? That was a really tough question.

The first word that came to my mind was "distributed". Heather, that term was in your definition as well.

Between centralized, decentralized, and distributed, there's actually some technical differences that I don't fully understand, but that are probably really important and have political implications.

Maybe part of it has to do with with scale. As a geographer, I come to a lot of questions through the lens of scale, but especially questions around decentralization. It may not seem particularly practical but the question for me would be, **at what scale is a network decentralized?** It can depend on how far you're looking into the network or what extent of the network you're looking at.

Mauve, when you mentioned things like, part of the network can be centralized underneath, that raises a lot of questions. To really call something decentralized, it depends on what scale we're looking at.

This came up for me in Elinor Ostrom's article that we read: great, cities are doing all this work to combat climate change. And it's a sort of decentralized approach to climate change. But cities are just one level of analysis. Yes, it's more decentralized than nation states are international agreements.

Cities also have their own structures that are very uneven and unequal, that we may not call distributed or decentralized.

**BRENDAN**: did I miss any hands? Does anybody feel like they have a burning thought right now they want to jump in on? Heather, go ahead.

**HEATHER**: I have two different things to throw into the mix that are not fully formed thoughts. They're more like just things I thought about while other people were talking.

One of them is actually me poaching an idea that I've heard Stefan bring up many times. This is in response to what Kelsey was saying about the trust issue, about this weird inversion of trust and our expectations of trust in the world of tech and and data versus the world of decentralized power in terms of political decision making and power.

Historically, or at least in our current moment, we think of politics as being a space that's value-laden, whereas science has meant to be value-free. It hasn't always been that way, but that's how it is now.

Stefan wrote a piece where he advocated for possibly flipping that on its head and **searching for value-free politics, and value-laden science**.

Now, that's not original. There's plenty of work out there by Bruno Latour and others about value-laden science. But then thinking of politics as something that could somehow be value-free– I can't speak to that, but I thought it played with this idea of trust.

**When we try to remove trust, in in the case of decentralizing knowledge networks, it's a way of us looking for a value-free tech.** 

In the other definition of decentralization, which was about politics– as Kelsey pointed out, what we're looking for is building trust, which is value-laden politics.

What happens if we stop trying to do away with the responsibility of trust in our tech, and data decentralization, and then stopped worrying about it quite so much in our decision-making networks?

I don't know if it would be good or bad, but if we change those definitions, do we have that gestalt shift, does it suddenly make everything else legible?

The other thing was in relation to what Mauve said, which was about the money problem. One way I think about the money problem is in relation to hoarding. Our problem with money right now is that there's people hoarding money. And our problem with centralized power networks are power, centralized power on the one hand and centralized networks of data. **Knowledge is again, there's a hoarding of capital. There's a hoarding of knowledge.**

Stefan and I used to organize something called the Wayward School that was skill and knowledge sharing workshops. We're both really interested in permaculture and do a lot of community building work. And we continually butt into this problem of, even when people are kind of interested in the idea of doing these things and becoming decentralized, becoming really DIY, they still like to hoard their knowledge. They like to be the one that knows how to brew something from scratch. Or they don't want other people know where you can gather nettle.

I know that's a really tangible, concrete example. And I'm not doing a great job of applying it to data and tech. But I think part of the thing we're all circling around is, what people go into it wanting, and then what it's capable of doing. And then what's gumming it all up.

**BRENDAN**: that's fantastic. I'm going to pick on either Dawn or Matt, who have been lighting up the chat, to come forth and share some views. Matt's pointing at Dawn, Dawn's pointing at Matt

**DAWN**: As a slight aside, I resonate super hard with what you just said, Heather about that hoarding of knowledge in some of those DIY spaces, having been active in them myself.

Lately, I'm on a reading group because of the recent election. In politics, **I think sometimes there's been a failure in those spaces to actually have an accurate analysis of power**. Maybe that's why they don't see what that does as a form of holding on to power. Because I think it's not always a sincere act, when people don't know how to let go of their knowledge.

What I was saying in the chat, I was trying to think of this thought experiment. It's a really cool inversion. If we want to figure out how to speak about science as value-laden, **what does it mean to think about politics as value-free?** I'm not sure if I would want such a thing

It felt a little bit like Fukuyama's argument about the "end of history", which is this, Oh, we tend towards Democracy, written in the 90s, like liberal Western democracies are this ascendant form. We did it, we cracked that nut. We've solved politics. And then it was like, Oh, actually, we haven't.

So I wonder if trying to think about how something gets rendered value-free helps you understand the assumptions and the things that are already like are currently treated as value-free that aren't around you. Maybe that's a powerful lens.

**BRENDAN**: Stefan.

**STEFAN**: I feel like I should clarify a bit. In no way would I be suggesting that it's possible to have a value-free politics, but it was rather just the flipping of the lens to help you see the the thing a little differently.

This is about seven or eight years ago now that I wrote all that stuff up, but I think I was turning to Manuel De Landa's work quite a bit at the time. He wrote a lot of stuff in his book, A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History, about how social and political forms are just these materialistic creations and you could study them in that very neutral way. I thought that was an interesting book.

Jumping on what Heather was saying about the knowledge network, some of the aspects that were in the Seeing Like a State reading, I think that that problem of hoarding is very, very funny to get around. And I think it's gendered. In the tech space, especially I see that is happening, I see that in any space where there's a lot of expertise and insight around having to really think through what you would call algorithmic thought.

This is another bridge to another conversation we're all having, which is this difference between the tech and the political and and how to think through them differently.

I would say that the distinction between algorithmic and heuristic thinking is really helpful on this front, because if you're looking at it algorithmically, you could see the code beneath the decentralized networks themselves as a form of centralization, in the sense that they had to be drafted and composed and written and agreed upon by a group of experts, similar to the way that laws within a legal code are also developed in that way. And so in a way law and legal code, although they exist within a centralized entity, are themselves decentered process; once they exist, they produce effects without too much human input, but the power gets baked into it. And the power gets baked into the decentralized technical network as well in this algorithmic way.

And then the heuristic element of decentralization is more around the squishy feelings that humans feel and the ideas and the values that they have and how they come together and reach agreement or work through disagreement around all of that. And in that way, heuristics and rules of thumb and principles and values and all of these phrases that we have to try to capture where I'm coming from on this issue, or whatever it might be, then come into play and then need to be conversed through in this non-representational way or at least like as as unmediated as possible way, synchronous communication, whatever you want to call it.

This whole conversation, I keep going back to all these dualisms and dichotomies, and I don't know what's going on. It's very strange.

**BRENDAN**: I want to try and pull some of that algorithmic and the sort of heuristics framing because I think that sort of echoes what Kelsey was saying a little bit about this cognitive dissonance of the word trust. And I want to again provide some anchoring on the technical side, just totally step into the technical side of this.

I think that there's a bit of a misnomer around the phrase "trustless environments", and so I'm gonna start from the technical framing, or the algorithm framing.

I think that if you really try to break it down and take as subjective a view as possible that a lot of the there is sort of a *cogito* in the modern decentralization movement. By *cogito* I mean like the the Cartesian sense of *ergo sum*: I think, therefore I am.

I think the *cogito* of trustless environments is cryptography. And I think that we believe and understand that, even in technical circles, when you talk about cryptography, it is oriented in math. And it feels like a universal law, right? it feels like when you encrypt something, its foundations are in mathematical proofs. And those mathematical proofs form a kind of rock upon which you can layer other techniques out of a sort of hell of trustlessness towards something that resembles trust. And I think that's the sort of framing that is positioned when we talk about decentralized technologies.

Personally, I intentionally want to invoke this Cartesian framing, because I think that it has a lot to say about a sort of gendered method of believing that you are capable of beginning at zero and moving to a completely cohesive system in a single line of thought. And I have to draw my hands on this, because what I think is scary about this framing is that along the way, you cannot do that without at some point layering on the technology that intertwines that heuristic framing, this set of values.

We can we have cryptography, cryptography, cryptography, if you look at any single thing, if you layer it up and you've turned it into bitcoin, you're now talking you've layered on a sort of capital, capital, capital market heuristic onto onto your technology. Or if you turn it into IPFS or debt you've now layered on a communication protocol, HTTP-type replica free information sharing slants to the way that you're thinking.

So I think there's a question about, what do we do with these things? And at what point do they stop? I think it's really interesting that both data and IPFS stop much sooner than a blockchain. 


As someone who has struggled with this a little bit on the tech side, I think there is a place where the heuristic enters, and it's very difficult to know what that is because you feel so confident because of the math.

**MATT**: This really makes you want to think about Walch and have the conversation about her piece on Deconstructing Decentralization. It seems to me that that what is at issue in that piece is where the ground is to be found laying the foundation of the argument. There's a repetition, maybe a different scale of the exact same kind of Cartesian error that you described: "I found certainty". Now we can start solving problems because certainty is here, right? And of course, what happens with Descartes is then you get Kant Fichte and Hegel and it gets more complicated, more difficult.

And in the same way, **the certainty of the cryptographic solution becomes an ideological condition, which which wins arguments that maybe it shouldn't win.** 

In Walch's argument is that you can find concentrations of power, and watch them being applied to these systems that you believe are immune to the application of power. What's useful about that is that it shows that the systems are not purely technical, but are also social. And when we pretend that they're purely technical, we misrepresent them to ourselves. And we also maybe participate a little bit in a con job, right? Bitcoin could be also interpreted as a huge con that's being run on the world economy.

I'd like to hear where you felt like she went wrong in that argument, because I was so friendly to it.

**BRENDAN**: I just felt like her argument was too weak. I think she attacked the wrong things.

I think if you're like, hey, a bunch of folks stepped into action and change and patched Bitcoin to prevent a centralization, or they behaved in a centralized way, and that should be cited as evidence that this is a an impurity in the system.

I agree that we should absolutely be using this other running. I just think it could be applied better.

It is proof that you could one day have a situation where someone could use that same set of 11 people in the Bitcoin security disclosure, could behave in a sort of odd, in a way that is a power grab. But I think that the design of the network itself invites much more interesting questions about about centralization, decentralization, and its central tenets or claims.

I think that there's a double click that happens when we call it a decentralized thing that we've all experienced firsthand. **We were sucked in for political reasons. And then the cryptography keeps us connected, because it seems to make good on some of those promises.** But that double click has already happened in my mind. That's why I like my version of it better. The idea that you think that you've got some incredibly decentralized space in cryptography, it's like, yeah, but like as soon as we hit some layer like this, this stops being the kind of decentralization that we showed up for.

The meaning of the phrase flips when we get to the technology. The thing that brought us there is not the thing that is keeping us here. And I think that that's more interesting to me personally.

To Mauve's point, you can write another implementation. I think that it's sad that we don't look at the fact that there are like, 25 bajillion currencies out there. That is in itself a kind of decentralization, and should be seen as points in the column of, well, Bitcoin isn't the only game in town. That's a form of decentralization. And it's not a fun one to look at. But I think there are better ways to do a takedown [than Walch uses].

**MAUVE**: I actually wish we had less of the logic around trust and less of the cryptographic proofs that we don't need to trust. **I think we should put trust on the people.** If I want to trust someone to have my data, I should trust them in meatspace.

Capturing every meaning of trust in a smart contract, it just doesn't make sense to me. Especially looking at real contracts and real promises you make to people– they're a lot more loose, and there's so much more ambiguity. In a machine, it's much harder to express that ambiguity and the fluid nature of trust and of agreements

Personally, I love crypto for making sure that data can't be intercepted or changed as it's being transported between people. But I'm not a fan of crypto automating decisions and stuff that humans could actually be doing in a way that makes more sense for their specific context rather than this imagined idea of what trust is for all of humanity or for the whole network.

**KELSEY**: We talked before about the problem of scale in trust in social societies, right? Where if it's 20 people, you can look around the room and be like, okay, we're all going to be nice to each other; there isn't gonna be one of us who comes in and just screws everything up. And if there is they'll leave, because that's how social cohesion works, in a way that it doesn't work on, say, a country scale, a city scale, a an internet scale.

So what about the idea that we use cryptography in networks to create not trustlessness– In the decentralized web, you have a lot of elements that you don't have to have trust about that you don't have to think about, right? Because there's all this hashed data. But ultimately, if you're trying to come back to a single root hash in order to ask for that root hash, or public key in the Dat case, you have to trust somebody. And **there is no version of a decentralized web framework where you don't have to trust anyone at all.**

**I feel like maybe what "trustless" systems are trying to do is not to get rid of trust, but to reduce the number of entities you actually have to trust to a size that is manageable on a social level.** 

**ERIC**: There's scale in the sense of number of people, but also geography, but then also temporal scale.

The Ostrom article talks about the need for more rapid decision-making around climate change,  so I wonder if there's something here about time, too.

**MAUVE**: I like the idea of reducing the number of people you need to trust for stuff to work, I actually really like that it makes trust a little bit more manageable.

The problem I have with the state of things is that the [specific] smaller amount of people you trust are either tech bros, who I find it very hard to trust, or investors of tech companies, or just like regular business people or people with money, which are all people that I don't want to trust as my building block.

**I'd rather trust a person I'm interacting with.** So I like when we can use tech for that and ignore some of the tech folks somehow or maybe find some tech folks that are more hippy dippy.

I think trusting fewer people is nice when those are people you *can* trust rather than those are people that you *have to* trust and can't really opt out of.

**DAWN**: I can connect to what you've just said, but also reeling it back a little bit going into what you said.

The cryptographic proof is this kernel or this small building block. I agree with Matt's response about the fact that these are always already socio-technical systems. The thing is that we've not figured out good ways of thinking those two things together, or a language that like reflects that, so we veer into one side or the other. That's what I'm interested in, is how to be aware of that and how to recognize that, doing that careful recognition around some of these decentralizing projects.

To think about this idea of trust rendered technical and its reliance on cryptography, as opposed to actual models of trust at scale: there's a concern I have with only using the concept of trust, because it's a form of methodological individualism. It's locating in an individual or at the scale of one person and their motivation, a way to think about phenomena that in collectives might be expressed differently.

I was thinking okay, what is trust? Like that I have one on one or like the trust that I would have with a group of 20 people, be they tech bros or not. And if whether or not what I don't want that to be like the kind of trust I have.

Maybe there is a way that some imperfect representation of that exists in like public key cryptography, say Coinbase or something. We have all these chains of proofs and ways that we say we know each other to each other and, publish that places. But that isn't the same way that trust– and trust isn't, there, the right word.

I'm comfortable being in a group of friends of friends, or if I'm in a circle where I know five people really close, but there's like 20 people there, but I would feel more comfortable saying something in that group than I would in another group.

**I was trying to think about where trust breaks down or if there's this implicit individualism that is being surfaced there.** And maybe there's other ways to think about it. And how are those being implemented technically?

I was actually thinking about on Scuttlebutt, that way of peer broadcasts or something about the way that you end up actually transmitting or just thinking about how that log functions is maybe a way that also doesn't rely on individual relationship.

**BRENDAN**: I think it's interesting, the centricity of the trust words. And I'm wondering if we just take a framing for a second–

It is a very common trick for tech when we're developing technologies to co-opt or adopt language. As the the second movers, we've pulled these meanings towards technical centers.

I feel like this conversation has centered around the phrase "trust", because of the way that the word trust is used to describe the environments that are on the technical side

It also feels like we have a similar double click phenomenon happening, where Mauve, you're talking about trust as a relationship between people, not as a provable thing, but we have this word trust that has been moved into this "provable thing" territory.

I want to know how others feel about the idea that in technology, we tend to lift these terms to describe technical concepts.

It seems to me to be part of this– if we just called it "snarfark" and said, it's the snarfark protocol, and then all it does is sort of some method of making sure that all of your data moves correctly.

**KELSEY**: Whenever we make qualitative things quantitative, we're usually wrong and trust things too much.

I'm trying to think of a good example. I know I've come across several recently, but I guess a canonical one would be the IQ test, where, to some extent it does measure intelligence and to another extent, it measures how well you match a training set. And to a third extent, that training set is based on your existing class and race. But because it's a number, and it was a way of turning things that were not originally quantifiable into something that looks a lot like math, we think it's right.

I worry a lot about when we start to move into quantifiable genetics spaces, where there are some data sets to draw on that are much larger than other data sets that we draw on. For example, my Native Alaskan ancestry means that a lot of the genetic testing that you can do is less valid in my case than in other cases, but there are no confidence intervals shown at the point of interpretation.

**I worry about anything that that turns something not math-y into something that looks math-y enough that people who don't understand how it came to be will just look at it and say, "well, that's probably right, it came out of a computer".**

**MAUVE**: To bring that towards the reading, I think Seeing Like a State, that was like the whole point of the book to me, because it was all people coming in and saying, we need to quantify stuff. And as part of the quantification, they introduced biases and erased a whole bunch of stuff that was actually super relevant to the context.

At the top you have a number. And that number is useful for a bureaucrat, but it's just completely destroying the actual context it's being applied on, which absolutely sucks. So I agree.

**BRENDAN**: Heather, you've got some great stuff going in chat. Do you want to jump in with any of that here?

**HEATHER**: 
I decided that maybe instead of taking notes, I should put my notes there, so they can be discursive. I realized just now, as you were talking that I accidentally wrote something as a statement, which I meant as a question, which was: we can and should ask about the motivations of the algorithm. I was asking that more like, shouldn't we? should we? Who are we questioning?

That was bringing me into these other places about corporate reality is what we're talking about right? That's the promise of these technologies, is that they're immortal, in some ways infallible, that they continue on into posterity.

So that's where my head is going with this discussion, but it keeps going back to straight up philosophical questions and you want to maybe pull it away from there back into these more specific questions about the technology itself.

I personally always have a hard time doing that because one of the motivating questions that I have, whenever I think about technology, media, electronic communications, and data networks, has to do with agency and whether or not text itself could be said to have agency. And thinking if languages are truly our first technology, because it's something that's outside of our body that extends our capabilities and can exist without us– it expands what we can do with our bodies, it's a tool, etc. Now, I don't think that sounds that crazy to all of you. But when I would posit that to my advisors when I was in dissertation mode, that was a real, "I don't know if I agree with that" kind of thing. And so therefore, I always come back to it as whether or not we can think of languages the first technology, and then also whether or not text can be said to have agency.

To me those questions are really alive in any discussion about blockchain, about decentralization, and all of the things we're bringing up here about trust and representation, which again, avatar representation, that means something stands in for something else. Again, that kind of extension of our self into a non-corporeal realm.

And then back to the Descartes that you brought up: I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am. I'm bringing that up in relation to what you had pointed out about. Math, mathematical proofs, and certainty. If we think of Cartesian as also being certainty, but it's actually rooted in doubt, and it also requires continual doubt, we find the truth, but we don't stay there.

Or as Spock would say, logic is the beginning of wisdom, not the end. So we have to continually doubt and displace and or else we stagnate; we become anaerobic, basically.

**DAWN**: I'll just plus one the whole thread that you brought up, Heather. I think there's a lot, and you referenced here at the beginning but I think in as well as other sides of technologies, scholars have talked a lot about agency beyond non-humans or agency of non-human, so beyond humans, and trying to study and understand that in context, and I think that's super fruitful.

I was reading this book lately by Mitcham, called Thinking through Technology: The Path between Engineering and Philosophy. About these early conceptualizations around technology and the distinction ignore some of its roots.

I think it can be helpful to connect the narrow way that sometimes we mean "digital technology" when we say "technology", but to reattach it to a much broader understanding of "technology" because I think that opens up a way of thinking about relationships to it.

**MATT**: The unit of the entity that participates in a decentralized system is important. If you have a collective of collectives with a rigid hub at the center where representatives of those collectives make decisions, is it nonetheless the case that we could describe that in some ways as a decentralized organizational structure?

**BRENDAN**: 
I think now's a great time to try and bring back one article that hasn't come up a ton, but I think might be fun to try and sew in as a theme here, see if we can connect some dots.

The Most Dangerous Notion in Reinventing Organizations. To me, one of the central thoughts brought forth there might be a fun thought to start to draw to a close with.

We started the conversation with this notion that decentralization is defined in opposition. I think, if we riff on the The Most Dangerous Notion in Reinventing Organizations article, it gets access to say, hey, this stuff has been around for a while. And maybe there are methods that of organizing that have existed for a long time that when we came in and sort of data colonized them, swept over some very subtle ways of moving and conducting ourselves, as was cited in this piece on the way that different indigenous Californian tribes are operating.

Are there other things that have existed outside of the technical framing, outside of the like political framing, or maybe inside of framing depending on how you want to think about it, that we trust over because of the direction the discussion has gone.

If we just thought about it as maybe there is a sort of original state or different state or a version of the world in which decentralization isn't the counter-hegemonic force.

**HEATHER**: You could argue that it always was, because in relation to chaos and order, order is constantly trying to deal with all of the stuff that it sees as too noisy and and not producing the right information. So they rely on each other. But depending on your perspective, you could absolutely see that it already always was and is predominant, and that everything else is just like a desperate attempt to try to get on top of that.

So I don't have an example of for your actual question, what are some ways that we see that becoming predominant, I would argue maybe it is. It's just our fear of it. Because we see it as messier. And that we don't just let it be.

**STEFAN**: I think that that Reinventing Organizations piece was very interesting to me in part because a lot of the work that we're doing in our coop now is modeled off of some of the agreements and the organizational DNA that's inside of the Enspiral Handbook. And I know that they're very influenced by Reinventing Organizations, amongst other ideas and whatnot.

I thought that what that article was getting at was also basically tying in with some of the other readings and some other readings that aren't in the reading list: Elinor Ostrom's work Governing the Commons.

A fascinating series of case studies in there that are all non-Western and all outside of the canon, about how people on the land base contextually responded to all of these different questions that we're dealing with here around power, around decision making, around all of that. 

A lot of the ideas that she was pointing out in that piece where we're looking at examples from First Nations communities within the United States and how they've managed themselves on the land base.

When we are looking at things like what James C. Scott was talking about, in Seeing Like a State, where he's talking about *metis* knowledge and these ideas around work to rule, this idea that workers within industrialized factories would buck the trend and strike while working by working to the rulebook. So working according to the algorithm as set out by management, then everything would be totally inefficient and ineffective and slow down. A way for them to resist was to completely follow the rule book. Because **what they were experiencing contextually in these spaces was a kind of heuristic algorithmic blend between the human and the machine** to try to understand how to make this thing operate the best way.

I think the same can be said about the blockchain space, which then to further on Brendan's critique of that one article. You could then say, that article does miss the point because **it's holding that entire ecosystem to this really difficult high standard that it's impossible to be held up to, because there will be a need to jump in and tweak the technicalities of the things to help it work better, because that's just how we relate with technology. That's how it has always been.**

Coming back to the land-based piece, I think that in terms of land base and in terms of the algorithmic and technical side of that, I think things like Internet of Things, all of these different technical networks that come into play with the land base in different ways, and measure it or monitor it or whatever, are very interesting sites to begin thinking about how we can take some of these older practices that have more to do with stewardship and sustainability and caring for the earth and caring for people and their relationship with the earth these permaculture principles, taking that and like plugging it into some of this new technology to see if there's a way that we can leverage that to to better deepen, to better democratize *metis* knowledge– because this is another thing that James C. Scott talked about was how *metis* knowledge was kind of undemocratic and coming back to what we were talking about earlier around people hoarding their knowledge. So maybe this is the way forward.

**MATT**: It's worth reflecting on the fact that the the idea of an algorithmic solution is related to the idea of a rigid, legal structure which guarantees equality before the law and was the kind of ideology that promotes those systems, those modernist systems that James Scott is deeply opposed to, has very important critiques of, was developed to address important kinds of injustice.

One interesting question is: **what is it about some systems that seem to promote or to dampen injustice without the rigid formality and weaknesses of algorithmic thinking?**

One thing about systems that are based in the land somehow is that **there's a shared commitment, which is very dependable to preserving the land; you can't get away with with abusing that commitment, partly because of social pressures, but also because the land is not forgiving of your destruction of it. The question is, where is that commitment in these other endeavors, or these other technologies? How do you guarantee that commitment?** Or how do you how do you promote or create that commitment? At least that was the question that that Stefan's thoughts raised for me. Is there some analogy that you can build into the system or promote at least in the system?

**DAWN**: To think about what some of those models of stewardship where say that maybe Ostrom profiles are the sort of history of Commons, forms of stewardship, or more conditional knowledge and traditional land practices practice by communities worldwide.

I also think: what were the other forms that they were in relation to? We read an article last semester from Peter Linebaugh about commons. He does this really intense way of talking about how a large percentage of UK was held in commons, but a lot of it wasn't.

I think a lot about, what were those practices operating alongside? And then I wonder, how do you attach that same level of commitment? And maybe these digital practices we're talking about, and how do we understand them and their relationship to the broader digital practices?

**BRENDAN**: This brings us to a close on our time. Thank you so much, everybody for joining. This was a delightful discussion. I do invite you to take a quick second. Think about that definition you wrote down an hour and a half ago and see if it shifted at all.

- 14:59:21	 From Eric : “direction, agency, and intention” - I like those three parameters for thinking about de/centralization
- 15:00:35	 From Kelsey : or as I like to think of it “treating people like adults"
- 15:02:32	 From Mauve : I actually started from technical and got more political as I learned more about it
- 15:03:48	 From Dawn . : I think that vitalik article is a super interesting study in the hidden assumptions that emerge when translating/operationalizing concepts into technical ~things~
- 15:03:57	 From Brendan O'Brien : stack:
- 15:04:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : Kelsey, Matt, Eric
- 15:04:45	 From Brendan O'Brien : I’ll jump on stack after eric
- 15:06:54	 From Dawn . : me too, I was so into that article. Want to re-read it immediately :))
- 15:07:05	 From Mauve : Could I comment on that?
- 15:07:27	 From Stefan Morales : bummer about the promise of tech not being met=understatement of the decade! lol
- 15:08:12	 From Kelsey : oh man just like capitalism!
- 15:08:43	 From Matt Price : Somehow the view of Catan behind Mo during a discussion about money, currency and centralization is giving me a whole new understnading.
- 15:10:16	 From Kelsey : From Walch/Crypto reading: Disambiguating "distributed" vs "decentralized": "decentralized" = nodes controlled by different parties, not necessarily true for distributed
- 15:11:56	 From Brendan O'Brien : Oh we’re big fans of those
- 15:13:17	 From Brendan O'Brien : I’ll jump on stack next
- 15:14:06	 From Matt Price : (re: Eric, citis, ostrom) I thought of Ostrom's article as part of a kind of Jane Jacobs axis that goes Jacobs - Scott - Ostrom, and strongly valorizes the spontaneous relationships and orderings that arise esp in urban spaces; so there seemed to me a bit of a romanicization of the power of those relationships/decisions to effect change at larger scales. 
- 15:14:06	 From Dawn . : Is value free politics ~= fukuyama and the end of history ?!
- 15:14:39	 From Matt Price : @dawn I'm not sure -- I am not sure I want a value free politics! 
- 15:14:51	 From Kelsey : curious how value-free vs. value-laden plays into our intertwined conceptions of what is legal & what is moral
- 15:15:05	 From Matt Price : can't remember who I heard say, a rational society would be a horror beyond all horrors. 
- 15:15:15	 From Kelsey : it’s also so caught up in the notion of corporations & whether they have any obligation to responsibility
- 15:15:19	 From Mauve : @matt Nice. 🔥🔥
- 15:15:26	 From Matt Price : maybe Iain Banks.
- 15:15:27	 From Dawn . : me either matt! I guess I felt an echo with that style of fukuyama's arguments
- 15:17:18	 From Eric : @matt - ooh interesting point about Jacobs/Ostrom
- 15:17:57	 From Matt Price : neat.
- 15:19:45	 From Brendan O'Brien : I’ll jump on stack next
- 15:21:04	 From Kelsey : a la racist algorithms in machine learning
- 15:21:17	 From Kelsey : the algorithms aren’t racist, the training datasets are
- 15:21:30	 From Heather : Decentered knowledge, baked in codes=headless corpse (Bataille’s)
- 15:22:00	 From Kelsey : searching for frameworks
- 15:23:45	 From Matt Price : adding myself to stack
- 15:23:47	 From Eric : @b5 for a quick second I thought you said cartography, oriented in maps, and I was like, wow geography is so important. but nope, that’s just me.
- 15:23:52	 From Kelsey : so, “trustless” networks reduces the number of entities we need to trust to a socially plausible number?
- 15:24:17	 From Kelsey : attacking the scale problem through cryptographic approaches
- 15:24:48	 From Dawn . : I feel like there is a dissertation in the gap between theory / reference implementations and applied cryptography 😬
- 15:24:54	 From Heather : a wrench we can throw in Descartes’ cogito ego sum is that some say a more accurate translation is:  I think therefore I doubt
- 15:25:42	 From Kelsey : ^ I love that and have not heard it before
- 15:26:33	 From Brendan O'Brien : I think we’ve got mauve on stack next?
- 15:26:45	 From Mauve : 👍
- 15:27:08	 From Heather : OH no I made a dumb typo! I meant to say:
- 15:27:15	 From Heather : "I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am")
- 15:28:39	 From Matt Price : nice @heather
- 15:30:13	 From Dawn . : Can I be on stack after Mauve? But weight me lower I think I've been a little too much on the talking side
- 15:30:51	 From Brendan O'Brien : SO MUCH THIS
- 15:31:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : Dawn on stack next
- 15:31:12	 From Kelsey : “meatspace” = irl
- 15:31:43	 From Kelsey : can I go on stack too?
- 15:31:49	 From Matt Price : how similar are promises and contracts, really?  aren't they pretty different?
- 15:31:49	 From Brendan O'Brien : yaya
- 15:32:00	 From Dawn . : kelsey before me pls!
- 15:33:30	 From Eric : it’s trust all the way down
- 15:33:43	 From Brendan O'Brien : Just like you need to trust someone before you visit http://shadyurl.com
- 15:34:01	 From Kelsey : oh jeez I really want to click that
- 15:34:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : DO NOT CLICK
- 15:34:10	 From Brendan O'Brien : I have no idea what it is
- 15:34:19	 From Brendan O'Brien : (Don’t trust me)
- 15:34:41	 From Brendan O'Brien : Then dawn!
- 15:35:34	 From Kevin : Vibez only
- 15:35:52	 From Kelsey : @mauve sounds like a need for the post-custodial archiving approaches we read about in Stewardship
- 15:37:46	 From Kelsey : trust as inherently drawing from our existing biases (personal or social) on “trustworthy”
- 15:38:49	 From Mauve : Scuttlebutt is my favorite cult. 💜
- 15:39:27	 From Kelsey : https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/ for anyone on the call not already initiated into what that is
- 15:40:03	 From Heather : @dawn we can and should ask about the motivations of the algorithm, (I’m not a coder or anything so maybe algorithm is not the right aspect of decentralized knowledge networks to refer to?)
- 15:41:01	 From Heather : This whole discussion is bringing me back to another important philosophical dichotomy (from post-structuralism and also psychoanalysis):  presence/absence
- 15:41:13	 From Mauve : ✋
- 15:41:17	 From Dawn . : @heather fair, I wouldn't disagree with that being a fruitful approach. I guess I'm not sure that would be sufficient (i.e., to only analyse the motivations) to understand the impacts and context they operate in
- 15:41:21	 From Brendan O'Brien : Mauve next!
- 15:42:42	 From Brendan O'Brien : data collection as a destructive, extractive process
- 15:44:29	 From Brendan O'Brien : kevin, was that a hand?
- 15:44:38	 From Kevin : +1 tech is 1st tech
- 15:44:41	 From Kevin : No hand
- 15:45:35	 From Kelsey : love that bc it leads to extending sapir-whorf (sp?) hypothesis to all technologies
- 15:46:33	 From Brendan O'Brien : Or you’re just flipping the framing :)
- 15:46:39	 From Kelsey : think of revolutions in mathematics like the existence of geometries other than Euclidian
- 15:46:56	 From Kelsey : there’s rarely one correct logic
- 15:47:02	 From Kelsey : (never?)
- 15:48:13	 From Matt Price : long hting I've bene typing
- 15:48:15	 From Matt Price : Several of these points are sort of swirling around together for me. 
- Crypto tries to take the social out of social interaction.  And trust is maybe just one part of what's being removed.
- This is related to the sort of creeping individualism that Dawn described. The thing that's called "provable trust" in crypto is related, not to the actual trust we have in actual people, but to the mechanisms that enable or guarantee good-faith interaction in anonymous contexts -- legal frameworks, criminal sanctions, with the idea that we can turn the law into a pure mechanism and thereby exorcise its tyrannical aspects. But (a) its unclear that this can be done, or that it would remove inequities; and (b) this has little to do with the value we place in trusting people.
- Coming back, again to Dawn, individualism, collectives, I have bee nwondering a little bit about the *scale of decentralizations*; what scale are the individual entities that participate in a "decentralized" system; are they persons, collectives, cor
- 15:48:16	 From Heather : @kelsey yes exactly, we are in the fractal (and other?) realm with these quandaries
- 15:49:35	 From Kelsey : it depends, is the central council advisory? ')
- 15:50:09	 From Dawn . : yeah non-euclidean geometery is super interesting! I really like Poincaré mathematian/philosophy badass
- 15:51:14	 From Mauve : Anarchy Works was a great book about alternative ways people have organized
- 15:51:48	 From Dawn . : one force among many?
- 15:51:48	 From Kelsey : Stefan had a hand
- 15:51:56	 From Brendan O'Brien : then stefan!
- 15:51:58	 From Brendan O'Brien : sorry!
- 15:53:23	 From Heather : @Brendan “data-colonized” did you say?  Was that from someone/somewhere or are you coining that? I want to borrow that term!
- 15:53:33	 From Brendan O'Brien : … made it up on the spot?
- 15:53:52	 From Brendan O'Brien : feels like a term this crowd came up with together :)
- 15:56:31	 From Heather : purity is inefficient
- 15:56:49	 From Heather : Scratch that, purity is vulnerable and unresilient
- 15:59:41	 From Brendan O'Brien : Land as centering, but not centralizing
- 16:00:21	 From Heather : does blockchain technology create the same sense of commitment to not “fouling the nest” that land-based decentralized knowledge networks do?
- 16:01:25	 From Brendan O'Brien : I think blockchain enthusiasts would argue yes, that they’re entirely oriented as systems that incentivize “good behaviour"
- 16:01:28	 From Mauve : @Heather, the commitment is through economic incentives
- 16:01:35	 From Brendan O'Brien : ^^ what mauve said
- 16:01:39	 From Kelsey : 4pm!
- 16:01:45	 From Kelsey : or whatever time it is for you
- 16:02:03	 From Eric : thank you for organizing!
- 16:02:11	 From Matt Price : thanks so much @b5!
- 16:02:13	 From Heather : To answer my own question… it does in the sense of creating scarcity, doesn’t it?  But also if we talk about the “commons” in relation to land-based, we are talking about a common (ubiquitous resource) that is not scarce (necessarily)
- 16:02:19	 From Dawn . : thanks for facilitating b5!
- 16:02:28	 From Matt Price : if it had been coherent, it would have changed :-)
- 16:02:38	 From Dawn . : So nice to see all your faces :))
- 16:02:45	 From Mauve : 💜💜💜
- 16:03:10	 From Kevin : Great to see everyone! And thanks Stefan and Heather for joining
- 16:03:25	 From Stefan Morales : Thank you for welcoming!
- 16:03:30	 From Brendan O'Brien : github.com/datatogether
- 16:03:43	 From Stefan Morales : Really enjoyable discussion everyone!
- 16:03:50	 From Dawn . : (when does it start up again?!)
- 16:03:53	 From Matt Price : this is my important find of hte day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73A0iMus8so 
- 16:04:08	 From Mauve : It was wonderful talking to y'all! Thank you for facilitating this! 💜💜
- 16:04:12	 From Kelsey : and please co-facilitate next semester! https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/71
- 16:04:33	 From Dawn . : @matt amazing!
- 16:04:34	 From Heather : Thank you for letting us join in!  I feel very bolstered by this discussion!
- 16:04:35	 From Kelsey : *reading list suggestions have been started but do need more suggestion & curation
- 16:04:48	 From Dawn . : my find: refused is making the tracks for cyberpunk 2077
- 16:05:34	 From Kelsey : oops now we stopped recording
