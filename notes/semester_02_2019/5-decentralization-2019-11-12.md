## Decentralization (November 12, 2019)

[🎬 **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/74jsTUzdOZc)

### Intro
True to form, we gathered readings in a decentralized way. Themes that emerged were: looking critically at how "decentralization" is defined, how it could/should be measured, and the sticky problems that aren't automatically solved (and sometimes are actually caused) by technology. The readings are chunked to break them up a bit. The first 3 focus on decentralized tech and apps, the next 3 on political decentralization, and the last 2 on decentralized knowledge creation and stewardship.

### Notes from readings
1. Sarah Friend. **Decentralization and its Discontents** 
  * 3 guiding q's
    * What is decentralization?
    * Do we want decentralization?
    * Are there limits to decentralization?
  * Defining decentralization: draws from political and then organizational contexts. So what is our context and how is it defined there?
    * We may bring several contexts and several definitions– technical on a protocol basis? Organizational? Archival?
  * Broad range of claimaints to "decentralization"
    * Characterization of a free market as by-nature decentralized– rational actors operating without centralizing system
    * Mao for decentralized socialism: "locally self-completed industrial system"
  * Lorentz curve & Gini coefficient used to measure decentralization of wealth
    * Applied to cryptocurrencies shows intense disparities
  * Why not centralization
    * "Our terms of service reserve the right for us to terminate users of our network at our sole discretion."
  * Governance & censorship: "Is there anything such that you would stop participating in the network?"
    * Nazis, child porn, etc.
  * Motives– broad umbrella! So many reasons to be interested
  * "Networks centralize for efficiency and decentralize for resilience"
  * Scalability trilemma
    * Decentralization (can run in small compute env at each user node)
    * Scalability (ability to process transactions efficiently)
    * Security (resources needed by a hacker)
    * "Decentralization is a stat we could lower to improve the other two"
  * Decentralization of manufacturing
    * 3 major RAM producers
    * Tech sensitive to localized natural disasters
  * Connection between centralization and specialization (bus factor!)
  * Process of the developers is not decebtralized, shown by Lorentz curve on open source projects commits per dev [starting here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRS9OW2IXhD3uboF7fDb8aBegEA7MzeqyJpGvoYxithpLYu__cwSyfZhmQj08mJvm1RPtPA6Du3bEeI/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.g451e42b6e3_0_41)
  * "Who and what are we serving with our particular decentralization?"
2. Angela Walch. (2019) **Deconstructing 'Decentralization': Exploring the Core Claim of Crypto Systems** 
  * Points of centralization in a mostly-decentralized system
    * Not really decentralized unless all the subsystems are decentralized, e.g. software dev process centralized to small group of developers
    * Concentration of wealth
    * Power of an exchange to include/disinclude
  * Decentralization conceptualized as a tool for disruption & revolution, break up existing power structures
  * Disambiguating "distributed" vs "decentralized": "decentralized" = nodes controlled by different parties, not necessarily true for distributed
  * Insights into decentralization
    * Decentralization is non-binary; it is multifaceted and each facet is on a spectrum
    * Decentralization changes over time
    * Decentralization can be used to hide power
  * Example of Bitcoin centralized decision making: 11 developers knew about a major bug and made a patch & decision to deliberately keep some info about that bug hidden *(Does this show centralization of power? Or could it show decentralization of initiative?)*
    * "..if some things have to be kept secret from others, the system is not decentralized." (19)
    * "moments of crisis uncover where actual power lies in a system"
    * *curious if there's a conflation of coordination with "centralization"*
  
3. Kleppmann, Martin & Wiggins, Adam & Hardenberg, Peter van & McGranaghan, Mark. **Local-first Software**
  * *These principles articulate an ideal more than they do an existing software practice*
  * Local-first means that though info can be on the cloud, your local copy is primary & it's a backup (vs: cloud is primary and yours is a cache)
  * Faster work b/c no need to bounce to remote server
  * Work is not trapped on one device, there's data sync
  * Network is optional to function
  * Collaboration seamless and supportive of varied workflows (e.g. suggest vs direct edit), Google Docs a key example
  * Should be archivable to be legible even if a service is no longer running
  * Privacy and security through end to end encryption: cloud service cannot decrypt
  * You own the data: can access, modify, copy
  
  > With data ownership comes responsibility: maintaining backups or other preventative measures against data loss, protecting against ransomware, and general organizing and managing of file archives. For many professional and creative users, as introduced in the introduction, we believe that the trade-off of more responsibility in exchange for more ownership is desirable. Consider a significant personal creation, such as a PhD thesis or the raw footage of a film. For these you might be willing to take responsibility for storage and backups in order to be certain that your data is safe and fully under your control.

4. Brancati, D. (2006). **Decentralization: Fueling the Fire or Dampening the Flames of Ethnic Conflict and Secessionism?**
  
  * Decentralization to localized gvt a *win* where it increases local participation but *bad* where it highlights differences between regions
    * Win more elections, greater influence on policy
    * Reinforce local identity, produce legislation that favors one group over another
  * Regional vs ethnic parties an important distinction

5. Elinor Ostrom. **Green from the Grassroots**

* Importance of enacting climate change policy at several layers of locality (city/state/federal/international)
  * We need to be able to evolve & adapt bc of high uncertainty
  * Research shows overlapping policies are more effective than a single overarching policy
* 30+ states and over 900 US cities have created plans despite lack of federal plan

6. Rachel-Rose O’Leary. **This North Syrian School Is a Baby Step Toward a Blockchain Society**

> ...North Syria’s governance structure, which consists of communes where people come together to take decisions at a local level. It’s here, Maxmud says, where blockchain can play a unique role. Using a distributed ledger for public accounting, communes can make their spending transparent and better manage collective resources
---

7. James C. Scott. (1998) **Seeing Like a State**

  > Any large social process or event will inevitably be far more complex than the schemata we can devise, prospectively or retrospectively, to map it. (309)
  
  * Importance of "improvisations, missteps, and strokes of luck" for success even in systems where rigid heirarchy is emphasized
  
  > ...the schemes that did not collapse altogether managed to survive thanks largely to desperate measures either not envisaged or else expressly prohibited by the plan." (310)
  
  > Formal order ... is always and to some considerable degree parasitic on informal processes, which the formal scheme does not recognize, without which it could not exist, and which it alone cannot create or maintain.
  
  * Work-to-rule strike: workers perform their tasks exactly according to rules (no improvisations or creativity) and thus productive work ceases
  * This is a reason why authoritarian control is dangerous & unproductive
  * *If we interact primarily in digitally mediated & built-environment spaces, what impact does that have on the availability of creativity? What important improvisations are not possible, given that code **is** a set of rules?*
  
  * Different measurement & classification types: imposed (central) & standard vs. local & useful. e.g. classifying plants by utility rather than genus
  * Practical knowledge derived through experimental solutions to a problem at hand
  * Connection to stewardship: (on derivation of practical knowledge) "these cultivators have a direct, vital stake..." (324)
  * Cases of practice preceding science b/c cause & effect of a local practice can be perceived by a motivated observer even if mechanism is unknown (325)
  
  > Metis ... is the mode of reasoning most appropriate to complex material and uncertain tasks where the uncertainties are so daunting that we must trust our (experienced) intuition and feel our way. (327)
  
  > Where the interactions involve not just the material environment but social interaction as well– building and peopling new villages or cities, organizing a revolutionary seizure of power, or collectivizing agriculture– the mind boggles at the multitude of interactions and uncertainties (as distinct from calculable risks). (327)

  * Advocates a "strategic retreat" from comprehensive planning. More about learning how to learn to build and doing it incrementally
  * Veillees in France: gatherings to swap local knowledge
  * Metis not evenly distributed, intersectional issues where concentrated into guilds, fraternities, etc.
  * Metis disappears as easier, cheaper solutions (e.g. pesticides) become available. This leads to centralized control– e.g. pharmaceuticals that can only be made in a lab via secret formula displace knowledge of natural, distributed, and freely available functional natural remedies
  * Capitalist profit requires efficiency + control (336) (not sure I followed this argument)

8. Jessica J. Prentice. **The Most Dangerous Notion in Reinventing Organizations** 
  
  > contemporary conventional farming as derived from European history can be seen as the predict-and-control approach to food production, whereas permaculture is absolutely about sense-and-respond

  > Holacratic domains function in an analogous way [to usufruct]: *they flow from use, familiarity, need, and negotiation*. Ownership, in this sense, is less an *exclusive possession* than an *explicit and privileged stewardship*.
  
  > In these small communities, where the network of family relationships was so dense and complex, public opinion so important, and social values so deeply ingrained, a strong and visible government was superfluous. (Margolin, "The Ohlone Way")
  
  > ...I believe that the headman received his leadership in the first place through the natural tendency of the members of the tribe to go to the most able member for advice. (Mayfield)
  
  > Another feature of the hunter-gatherer way of life is a deep respect for individual decisions. There are experts rather than leaders, men or women whose skills are revered; but decisions about whether to follow their lead or take their advice are matters of individual choice. (Brody)

## Questions/Themes

## Discussion
- B5: Decent draws many people in and is adjacent to terms like disrupt
    - 3 buckets: tech, group, state
    - If you haven't already, what does decentralization mean to you? And review at end of session
- Intros round! U of T, tech consulting & cooperatives, EDGI, Dat, artist, culture and technology, etc! (Not evenly represented in this list)
- Readings in 3 major groups. Sarah Friend a great framing with 3 questions right away:
    - What is decentralization?
    - Do we want decentralization?
    - Are there limits to decentralization?

- Mauve: Power is bottom up. Individuals have autonomy. Consensus with each other rather than top-down. Having power spread up and organizing up
- Dawn: Lean on textbook definition: delegating decision-making and activity from a central org. Has a political context
    - Glad readings were both tech and political side of coin
    - Way back when first session - lineage of term. Where has 'decentralization' been used?
- KB: Defining is harder than we think because it's defined in opposition. There's a tendency to centralization. Easy to have one source of truth. Harder for several points of input
    - Richard Bartlett - decent cooperative in Enspiral. They have to actively work to decentralize. If you don't name people, you have people secretly in charge

- Heather: Distributed network where power is not top-down. Struggled after saying 'distributed'. 'Decentralized' is already a negation. Knowledge, power structures are emergent. Decision-making, in charge, responsibility are emergent properties.
    - One place to look is pedagogy like Montesorri, Waldorf. Inquiry based learning. Did not have this type of learning growing up, maybe  now there is better language

- SM: Couldn't define it. But then hearing others, wanted to add a layer: X/Y axis with decentralization and representation.
    - Centralization - representation and media
    - Decentralization - more facilitation
    - A lot of examples of decent are people governing themselves: facilitation, communication. Centralization is less 2-way communicating, more broadcast

- B5: Interesting that a lot comes from political. Hearing power a lot
    - If we can think decentralization exists on a spectrum, do we have to consider whole spectrum to examine this properly
    - Decentralization from tech, Butavik definition
        - Does network scale?
        - Control - no 51%
        - ??
    - We want to have an effect on a method of organizing
- KB: Like the specifity of definition because it defines power. Code is made of rules
    - Social structures - increase trust,
    - Technical - removing need of trust
    - Cognitive dissonance, none of the metaphors work
- MP: One way to begin, what qualities or associations does decent have moral, is good
    - Technial - robustness of network
    - Politcal - liberatarian, anarachist - where does good reside? Shared language
    - I am guilty of slippage between tech and political
    - attributing moral to tech structures, no need for those structures to decentralziae power
        - decent tech can still centralize power
- Mauve: Bitcoin, blockchain are excellent example of decent tech that are centralized underneath. 
    - Inside money. How do I make, keep money. If you have money, then you have power and can make more money. Even if distributed, the power dynamics aren't decentralized
    - Decentralized is one thing, but is it distributed, p2p. Technical qualifiers 
- EN: I'm not a technical person, not where I come at it. More from the political end. First word that came to mine was 'distributed'. 
    - There is a technical difference between centralized, decentralized, distributed. 
    - Don't fully understand differences but probably have political implications
    - At what scale is a network decentralized? How far are you looking at the network? What extent?
    - If things can be hidden underneath, then to examine 'decent' what scale or extent are we looking at?
    - Ostrom reading - cities are a different scale than nation
- Heather: Related to trust issue - historically politicals is value-laden and science should be science-free. How about flipping that?
    - Bruno Latour - value-laden science
    - When we try to remove trust - looking for value-free tech
    - Politics - we're looking to build trust, value-laden
    - What happens if we look at the ??
    - Related to Mauve and money problem - hoarding. Centralized power and networks of data/knowledge - hoarding of power and knowledge
    - Even when people are interested in DIY, they still like to hoard knowledge. We're circling around - what people go *into* it wanting, vs what we are *capable* of/how it plays out, what do we want?

- DW: Might be a failure of analysis of power. Not a sincere act when people don't know how to let go of their knowledge. 
    - Cool thought experiment of flipping science as value-laden and politics value-free
    - Liberal Western democracies are believed to be ascendent. How do we think ???
- SM: Don't want completely value-free politics, just the flipping is a good thought experiment
    - The problem of hoarding is funny to get around, seems gendered. In the tech space especially, or any field of expertise, algorithmic thought. Tech vs political
    - Difference between algorithmic and heuristic thought
        - Code is centralized - drafted, coded by experts like legal code. Once they exist they have effects, but power is baked into it
        - Heuristic - squishy feelings that humans feel, ideas and values, how we come to agreement
    - These conversations keep leading me to dichotomies. Not sure what's going on
- B5: Yes, cognitive dissonnce. 
    - Think there is a misnomer around trust-less. Cogito of trust-less is cryptography. Orientated in math and feels like universal law. Founded on math proofs that provide a rock, that trust...
    - Cartesian framing has...
- MP: Where is the ground/foundation of argument to be found? The certainly of crypto becomes ideological. That wins arguments that it maybe doesn't deserve to win. You can find concentrations of power and watch them in systems that... systems aren't purely tech, also social
- B5: ...
- Mauve: Wish less logic around trust. Crypto proofs so we don't need to trust people. If I want to trust someone with my data, I should trust them in meatspace (in real life).
- KB: Problem of scale of trust in social societies. 20 people in a room - we'll be nice to each other, doesn't work on a country, city, internet-scale
    - What about if we don't use crypto for trustlessness. In the decent web... to get root hash, you have to trust somebody. There's no version where you don't have to trust anyone at all. Not to get rid of trust, but reduce entities you have to trust to managable size of social level
- EN: Time-scale, Ostrom 
- Mauve: Like reducing trust, but groups of techbros or investors/banks...
- Dawn: crypto proof as kernal. These are always sociotechinical systems. Hard to think of language for both, we veer into one or the other. How do we recognize that?
    - Trustlessness rendered as technical rather than... Only using trust is only locating in the individual. In collectives it might be expressed differently. Where does it break down? Implicitly individualism. SSB - peer broadcast
- B5: Trust - common for tech to co-opt or adopt language. We pull them forward to technical centers. Trust - moved into provable thing
- KB: when qualitative to quantitative like IQ test, worry about anything that turns non-math into math. That probably looks right because it came out of a computer
- Mauve: Seeing as a state - quantifying stuff, then erased context
- Heather: Corporeality. Promises of tech: immortal, continues to posterity
    - "Agency" - language as the first technology? does text have agency?
    - representation, avatar
    - Cartesian - rooted in doubt, requires continual doubt. Continual doubt and displace. Logic is the beginning of wisdom
- Dawn: Agency beyond humans
    - reattach to broader understandings of technology
- Matt: The unit/entity that participates in decentralization is important
    - If you have collective of collectives, with hub that folks make decisions
- B5: Maybe there are methods of organizing that have been happening for a long time
- Heather: 
- Stefan:

14:39:26	 From Matt Price : 15cm
14:39:37	 From Matt Price : it's like a real snow 
14:40:10	 From Matt Price : I was WW kayaking sunday morning.  and then a snow storm yesterday
14:40:48	 From Kevin : I can help with notes
14:41:06	 From Matt Price : oh me too, I'll help
14:41:14	 From Kevin : thanks Matt
14:41:18	 From Kelsey : Semester 3: https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/71
14:42:33	 From Kelsey : Shared notes: https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw?both
14:44:06	 From Kelsey : that’s harder than expected
14:49:55	 From Kelsey : Welcome, Heather!
14:51:55	 From Dawn . : add me on stack b5!
14:52:45	 From Brendan O'Brien : Go it
14:52:50	 From Brendan O'Brien : *got it
14:52:52	 From Kelsey : Etiquette note: if you want to speak, raise your hand or request to be put on stack in the chat here, and the facilitator will pay attention and call on you
14:54:00	 From Brendan O'Brien : I have Kelsey next
14:55:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : Reminds me of “counterdisintermediation”
14:55:24	 From Dawn . : autonomous? self-determining?
14:56:13	 From Stefan Morales : I have a thought next!
14:56:26	 From Brendan O'Brien : then Stefan!
14:57:39	 From Brendan O'Brien : My fav is “rhizomes”
14:59:18	 From Kelsey : Love that– strong tie btw the pedagogy thought & the self-determination thought. I’m a montessori kid! V much about “intrinsic motivation"
14:59:21	 From Eric : “direction, agency, and intention” - I like those three parameters for thinking about de/centralization
15:00:35	 From Kelsey : or as I like to think of it “treating people like adults"
15:02:32	 From Mauve : I actually started from technical and got more political as I learned more about it
15:03:48	 From Dawn . : I think that vitalik article is a super interesting study in the hidden assumptions that emerge when translating/operationalizing concepts into technical ~things~
15:03:57	 From Brendan O'Brien : stack:
15:04:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : Kelsey, Matt, Eric
15:04:45	 From Brendan O'Brien : I’ll jump on stack after eric
15:06:54	 From Dawn . : me too, I was so into that article. Want to re-read it immediately :))
15:07:05	 From Mauve : Could I comment on that?
15:07:27	 From Stefan Morales : bummer about the promise of tech not being met=understatement of the decade! lol
15:08:12	 From Kelsey : oh man just like capitalism!
15:08:43	 From Matt Price : Somehow the view of Catan behind Mo during a discussion about money, currency and centralization is giving me a whole new understnading.
15:10:16	 From Kelsey : From Walch/Crypto reading: Disambiguating "distributed" vs "decentralized": "decentralized" = nodes controlled by different parties, not necessarily true for distributed
15:11:56	 From Brendan O'Brien : Oh we’re big fans of those
15:13:17	 From Brendan O'Brien : I’ll jump on stack next
15:14:06	 From Matt Price : (re: Eric, citis, ostrom) I thought of Ostrom's article as part of a kind of Jane Jacobs axis that goes Jacobs - Scott - Ostrom, and strongly valorizes the spontaneous relationships and orderings that arise esp in urban spaces; so there seemed to me a bit of a romanicization of the power of those relationships/decisions to effect change at larger scales. 
15:14:06	 From Dawn . : Is value free politics ~= fukuyama and the end of history ?!
15:14:39	 From Matt Price : @dawn I'm not sure -- I am not sure I want a value free politics! 
15:14:51	 From Kelsey : curious how value-free vs. value-laden plays into our intertwined conceptions of what is legal & what is moral
15:15:05	 From Matt Price : can't remember who I heard say, a rational society would be a horror beyond all horrors. 
15:15:15	 From Kelsey : it’s also so caught up in the notion of corporations & whether they have any obligation to responsibility
15:15:19	 From Mauve : @matt Nice. 🔥🔥
15:15:26	 From Matt Price : maybe Iain Banks.
15:15:27	 From Dawn . : me either matt! I guess I felt an echo with that style of fukuyama's arguments
15:17:18	 From Eric : @matt - ooh interesting point about Jacobs/Ostrom
15:17:57	 From Matt Price : neat.
15:19:45	 From Brendan O'Brien : I’ll jump on stack next
15:21:04	 From Kelsey : a la racist algorithms in machine learning
15:21:17	 From Kelsey : the algorithms aren’t racist, the training datasets are
15:21:30	 From Heather : Decentered knowledge, baked in codes=headless corpse (Bataille’s)
15:22:00	 From Kelsey : searching for frameworks
15:23:45	 From Matt Price : adding myself to stack
15:23:47	 From Eric : @b5 for a quick second I thought you said cartography, oriented in maps, and I was like, wow geography is so important. but nope, that’s just me.
15:23:52	 From Kelsey : so, “trustless” networks reduces the number of entities we need to trust to a socially plausible number?
15:24:17	 From Kelsey : attacking the scale problem through cryptographic approaches
15:24:48	 From Dawn . : I feel like there is a dissertation in the gap between theory / reference implementations and applied cryptography 😬
15:24:54	 From Heather : a wrench we can throw in Descartes’ cogito ego sum is that some say a more accurate translation is:  I think therefore I doubt
15:25:42	 From Kelsey : ^ I love that and have not heard it before
15:26:33	 From Brendan O'Brien : I think we’ve got mauve on stack next?
15:26:45	 From Mauve : 👍
15:27:08	 From Heather : OH no I made a dumb typo! I meant to say:
15:27:15	 From Heather : "I doubt, therefore I think, therefore I am")
15:28:39	 From Matt Price : nice @heather
15:30:13	 From Dawn . : Can I be on stack after Mauve? But weight me lower I think I've been a little too much on the talking side
15:30:51	 From Brendan O'Brien : SO MUCH THIS
15:31:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : Dawn on stack next
15:31:12	 From Kelsey : “meatspace” = irl
15:31:43	 From Kelsey : can I go on stack too?
15:31:49	 From Matt Price : how similar are promises and contracts, really?  aren't they pretty different?
15:31:49	 From Brendan O'Brien : yaya
15:32:00	 From Dawn . : kelsey before me pls!
15:33:30	 From Eric : it’s trust all the way down
15:33:43	 From Brendan O'Brien : Just like you need to trust someone before you visit http://shadyurl.com
15:34:01	 From Kelsey : oh jeez I really want to click that
15:34:06	 From Brendan O'Brien : DO NOT CLICK
15:34:10	 From Brendan O'Brien : I have no idea what it is
15:34:19	 From Brendan O'Brien : (Don’t trust me)
15:34:41	 From Brendan O'Brien : Then dawn!
15:35:34	 From Kevin : Vibez only
15:35:52	 From Kelsey : @mauve sounds like a need for the post-custodial archiving approaches we read about in Stewardship
15:37:46	 From Kelsey : trust as inherently drawing from our existing biases (personal or social) on “trustworthy”
15:38:49	 From Mauve : Scuttlebutt is my favorite cult. 💜
15:39:27	 From Kelsey : https://www.scuttlebutt.nz/ for anyone on the call not already initiated into what that is
15:40:03	 From Heather : @dawn we can and should ask about the motivations of the algorithm, (I’m not a coder or anything so maybe algorithm is not the right aspect of decentralized knowledge networks to refer to?)
15:41:01	 From Heather : This whole discussion is bringing me back to another important philosophical dichotomy (from post-structuralism and also psychoanalysis):  presence/absence
15:41:13	 From Mauve : ✋
15:41:17	 From Dawn . : @heather fair, I wouldn't disagree with that being a fruitful approach. I guess I'm not sure that would be sufficient (i.e., to only analyse the motivations) to understand the impacts and context they operate in
15:41:21	 From Brendan O'Brien : Mauve next!
15:42:42	 From Brendan O'Brien : data collection as a destructive, extractive process
15:44:29	 From Brendan O'Brien : kevin, was that a hand?
15:44:38	 From Kevin : +1 tech is 1st tech
15:44:41	 From Kevin : No hand
15:45:35	 From Kelsey : love that bc it leads to extending sapir-whorf (sp?) hypothesis to all technologies
15:46:33	 From Brendan O'Brien : Or you’re just flipping the framing :)
15:46:39	 From Kelsey : think of revolutions in mathematics like the existence of geometries other than Euclidian
15:46:56	 From Kelsey : there’s rarely one correct logic
15:47:02	 From Kelsey : (never?)
15:48:13	 From Matt Price : long hting I've bene typing
15:48:15	 From Matt Price : Several of these points are sort of swirling around together for me. 
- Crypto tries to take the social out of social interaction.  And trust is maybe just one part of what's being removed.
- This is related to the sort of creeping individualism that Dawn described. The thing that's called "provable trust" in crypto is related, not to the actual trust we have in actual people, but to the mechanisms that enable or guarantee good-faith interaction in anonymous contexts -- legal frameworks, criminal sanctions, with the idea that we can turn the law into a pure mechanism and thereby exorcise its tyrannical aspects. But (a) its unclear that this can be done, or that it would remove inequities; and (b) this has little to do with the value we place in trusting people.
- Coming back, again to Dawn, individualism, collectives, I have bee nwondering a little bit about the *scale of decentralizations*; what scale are the individual entities that participate in a "decentralized" system; are they persons, collectives, cor
15:48:16	 From Heather : @kelsey yes exactly, we are in the fractal (and other?) realm with these quandaries
15:49:35	 From Kelsey : it depends, is the central council advisory? ')
15:50:09	 From Dawn . : yeah non-euclidean geometery is super interesting! I really like Poincaré mathematian/philosophy badass
15:51:14	 From Mauve : Anarchy Works was a great book about alternative ways people have organized
15:51:48	 From Dawn . : one force among many?
15:51:48	 From Kelsey : Stefan had a hand
15:51:56	 From Brendan O'Brien : then stefan!
15:51:58	 From Brendan O'Brien : sorry!
15:53:23	 From Heather : @Brendan “data-colonized” did you say?  Was that from someone/somewhere or are you coining that? I want to borrow that term!
15:53:33	 From Brendan O'Brien : … made it up on the spot?
15:53:52	 From Brendan O'Brien : feels like a term this crowd came up with together :)
15:56:31	 From Heather : purity is inefficient
15:56:49	 From Heather : Scratch that, purity is vulnerable and unresilient
15:59:41	 From Brendan O'Brien : Land as centering, but not centralizing
16:00:21	 From Heather : does blockchain technology create the same sense of commitment to not “fouling the nest” that land-based decentralized knowledge networks do?
16:01:25	 From Brendan O'Brien : I think blockchain enthusiasts would argue yes, that they’re entirely oriented as systems that incentivize “good behaviour"
16:01:28	 From Mauve : @Heather, the commitment is through economic incentives
16:01:35	 From Brendan O'Brien : ^^ what mauve said
16:01:39	 From Kelsey : 4pm!
16:01:45	 From Kelsey : or whatever time it is for you
16:02:03	 From Eric : thank you for organizing!
16:02:11	 From Matt Price : thanks so much @b5!
16:02:13	 From Heather : To answer my own question… it does in the sense of creating scarcity, doesn’t it?  But also if we talk about the “commons” in relation to land-based, we are talking about a common (ubiquitous resource) that is not scarce (necessarily)
16:02:19	 From Dawn . : thanks for facilitating b5!
16:02:28	 From Matt Price : if it had been coherent, it would have changed :-)
16:02:38	 From Dawn . : So nice to see all your faces :))
16:02:45	 From Mauve : 💜💜💜
16:03:10	 From Kevin : Great to see everyone! And thanks Stefan and Heather for joining
16:03:25	 From Stefan Morales : Thank you for welcoming!
16:03:30	 From Brendan O'Brien : github.com/datatogether
16:03:43	 From Stefan Morales : Really enjoyable discussion everyone!
16:03:50	 From Dawn . : (when does it start up again?!)
16:03:53	 From Matt Price : this is my important find of hte day: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73A0iMus8so 
16:04:08	 From Mauve : It was wonderful talking to y'all! Thank you for facilitating this! 💜💜
16:04:12	 From Kelsey : and please co-facilitate next semester! https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether/issues/71
16:04:33	 From Dawn . : @matt amazing!
16:04:34	 From Heather : Thank you for letting us join in!  I feel very bolstered by this discussion!
16:04:35	 From Kelsey : *reading list suggestions have been started but do need more suggestion & curation
16:04:48	 From Dawn . : my find: refused is making the tracks for cyberpunk 2077
16:05:34	 From Kelsey : oops now we stopped recording
