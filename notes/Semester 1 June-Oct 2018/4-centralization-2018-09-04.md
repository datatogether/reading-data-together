## Centralization vs. Decentralization (and Peer-to-peer, Federation) (Sept 4)

[🎬 **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/E1bGmEnjYAM)

### Intro

Now that we've thought more about possession and ownership let's return to thinking about just how decentralization differs from centralizations (and whether or how peer-to-peer or federation fit in)!

**Readings**:

- Nathan Schneider (2017) "The Irresistible Power of Decentralization"—and Its Elusiveness (DRAFT--not for circulation)
- Executive Summary (6 pages) of [Defending Internet Freedom through Decentralization: Back to the Future?](https://dci.mit.edu/research/the-decentralized-web)
-  _See also_: [Beyond distributed and decentralized: what is a federated network? Networked Cultures](https://networkcultures.org/unlikeus/resources/articles/what-is-a-federated-network/)
-  _See also_: P2P Foundation wiki entry on [Peer_to_Peer](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_to_Peer)

### Themes

- Do people see themselves agreeing with (or using) "decentralization" as an ambiguous term, "potent ideology," or "floating signifier"?
  > on that "broadcasts fluency and belonging in a dynamic discourse community more than as a rigid methodology"
  > "For the sake of a common enterprise, such a term does the service of obscuring the contradictions at play—at least temporarily"

- Schneider challenges us to define our goals better; the polyvalence of "decentralaized" tends to stand in ofr political/ideological aims, sometimes improperly so. What are our "ends"?
  > As these lineages interact and combine, the term migrates from being a means for certain ends to nearly an end in itself, thanks to the performative functions it has come to hold in certain subcultures.

- What do you make of Schneider's exhortation "those seeking to decentralize something should be prepared to know how to centralize as well"?

- What is the value of differing and granular concepts like peer-to-peer, federated, and distributed, decentralized? Especially when those terms are contentious/admit of not easy or agreed upon definition?

- The Barabas et al. (MIT) report identifies the major challenges for decentralized systems as: user and developer adoption, security, monetization and incentives, and "resisting consolidation," does this reflect your understanding? are there others you would add?

- What is the relationship between technical possibility and desire for decentralized, federated, and "open protocol" internet?
  - or: Is a decentralized/federated/open web even possible? Or will forces of market consolidation re-centralize any attempt
  - further: Is a decentralized/federated/open web even desireable?

- Barabas et al. put forward a (perhaps controversial) view that on its face does not appear to challenge Scheinder's account of an "accountable" centralization. What drawbacks do you see?
  > "This type of consolidation into a few super-participants might be inevitable due to economies of scale. We are increasingly persuaded that this isn't necessarily a bad thing, and that a more realistic goal might be the development of a robust, competitive marketplace that offers a range of ground rules for online speech, rather than a return to a purely peer-to-peer architecture for communication online."
  > cf. Schneider: "We should care less, ultimately, about whether something is centralized or decentralized than whether it is accountable. An accountable system is responsive to both the common good for participants and the needs of minorities; it sets consistent rules and can change them when they don’t meet users’ needs.""

- What are the "preconditions for success" of these new projects? Barabas et al. state:
  > "A precondition for the success of these distributed platforms is a shift towards user-controlled data, the ownership of a user’s social graph and her intellectual property created online"

- Is there something about "purity" as opposed to "hybridity" that we should be attending to when seeking out these concepts?

### Questions

- Hard to resist this gem near the start, but I am interested to hear how much it accords with the experience of those more involved in these conversations:
  > “It seems like [many of the Bitcoin folks] are trapped in some horrible Sartre play where everyone has to use the word ‘decentralized’ to mean different things” (Green, 2017)

- Means and ends in schneider: decentralization becoming an end in itself? (some reasons that are nuanced)
- Us to interrogate our own role/claim?
- Accountability as a pivot

I'm working down below in "notes"

### Discussion

Things we want to be sure to discuss:
- bitcoin/sartre comparison
- means/ends
- Accountability question - accountability as a pivot
- Do we find ourselves using 'decentralization' in multiple ways?
- injunction to "learn how to centralize as well"
- "is a decentralied web even possible, or desirable"?
- what are the preconditions of success for a decentralized project? cf Barabas, `a shift towards user-controlled data, the ownership of a user’s social graph and her intellectual property created online`

- Jack: Schneider 9p.12) on morality & peity.  Where are the moral struggles, exacly? and also
- Jack: being acocuntable can be intrinsically good; being decentralized -- I doubt it.

- b5 political v. technical decentralization? the two spaces leave things to a different degree of messy?
    - Is accountability a way to shohorn the two?
    - What would the notion of accountability in practice look like on both theyse sides

- matt p: a reason to divide tech/political: seperate lineages to some extent. In the tech side an unacknowledged tendency to raise decentralization up as its own virtue
    - that loads the term decentralization, makes it carry weight. Useful tool because it means different things to different people-- garner alliers we might not actually be allied with.
    - We may never have articulated the ideological goods that actually matter to use
    - We may become in thrall to our own concepts... pursuing goals without the moment of reflection required to meet the goals taht we actually have
- DW: extending that -- I was convinced that havinga term that temporarily obscures tensions/contradictions is useful, but we need to be able to snap back to clarity. Acocuntability may do that, but maybe not completely. Being "on side" with people you might not always have affinity has some advantages, but maybe not enough.  
- DW can we refocus on means/ends?
- MZ: "preconditions for success" -- quote suggests "ownership of a user's social graph and control thereof" is one of those conditions.  Is that an end? I (MZ) personally think a healthier economy is one where as many participants as possible have control over the economy -- this is about enfranchisement, who gets to act as an agent in the economy. Who gets to make decisions about how their property is exchanged, and who gets to profit from this property.  This touches on many complex questions which aren't themselves resolved.  
    - DW: "equipotency of participants" as a north star -- free participation of all users. Quote from P2P foundation:
        > **equipotency** of its participants, organized through the free cooperation of equals in view of the performance of a common task, for the creation of a common good, with forms of decision-making and autonomy that are widely distributed throughout the network."
    - MZ: when a small number of persons own hte means of production, we end up with forms of oppression.  So opening up the menas of production to broad ownership fixes that problem.  
- RG: warning for anyone who considers decent. to be the ultimate goal/end; in many situations, when people felt agency, some tool came along and people traded away their agency for some kind of efficiency. There are many examples of htis in many domains. If decent. is your goal, then agency also has to be core somehow with every node in the network.  
- MP: Lots coming up from the previous points. Thoughts that Schnieders account of centralizing tendencies in bitcoin convincing-- in principle versus in practice (90% of miners on one stage)
    - decentralization in one domain looks like centralization in another domain
    - rico's comment rich: domains to think about trading away of autonomy. Hobbes on social contract, versus Marxist view on development of capital -- individual autonomy for efficiency
- Seong: if decentralized networks tend naturlaly towards centalization then this is siilar to the way we have been thinking about hte ocmmons -- though we might begin with decentralized networks, like free markets, those networks tend towards centralization and monopoly when left to their own devices.  [missed something about public sector]. cf. NZ healthsystem; there are district hospitals that local hospitals report back to;  [sorry lost the thread here].  Schneider suggests there's an American longing for decentralization which has dep roots; but that decentralization has often worsened inequality, and real power has become more focussed in the hands of the few.  So I wonder whether -- agai ncf. Schneider -- whether our conceptions of what an individual is, whether that's what's ocnfusing our notion of centralizaition/decentralization. And if it's perhaps related to the way it attracts connotations of virtue, and of democracy.  
- Davidad: P2P is based on an _assumption_ of equipotency -- but the reality seems to have largely been different!  and also: joining a mining pool is an excellent example of trading your autonomy for security (cf. Rico)
- JC: it can be difficult to figure out what a "public good" is -- almost everything that you could offer is mired in inherent fuzziness -- it comes down to terminal value judgments about very deeply nested ideas.  I've been thinking of vernacular critiques of the tech industry; many are about the notion that tech fetishizes creative destruction for no reason, except that the new person gets to be on the gorund floor or something.  That is, "creative destruction" is just a way to replace an existingelite with a new one.  Maybe we need a metric like "was anything novel actually achieved with the supplanting of the old system in favour of the new"? a lot of decentralization rhetoric doesn't give users positive reasons to switch, beyond "we're not FB or twitter or amazon".
- DW: relation of individual to collective action, and the further relation of this relationship to the state -- if in the rhetoric of decent, it's all abouthte elimination of institutions, the rehtoric misses important questions of either reform of existing institutions, and scale of operation of new institutions brought into being by these nominally decentralizing projects.  [missed a bit] cf: scams happen on facebook ,but vulnerable populations at lesat have some protection via FB moderation. what happens on scuttlebutt to those populations?
- EN: Schneider's discussion of protocols, `To participate in the decentralization any of these systems offers, one must submit to its protocols…” (p. 23)` this is illuminating for me.  but also re "equipotency", cf. schneider p. 26 re: people ocming to platforms iwth diverse capacieites and opportunities, and centralization often occurs via processes that are "external" to the platforms technical design. Users bring their whole lives to whatever they're doing.  Accounting for that seems really important.  A platform that doesn't address that may ultimately reinforce inequalities. and hten finally , we should discuss trust and trustless ness.
    > People come with diverse capacities and opportunities, and recentralization occurs through inequalities of access and power that are external to the system
    - b5: current Internet is quite mature; bar for switching is very high. but maybe if we siwtch away from the moral imperative for a bit; we have decent as a set of tools that potentially open up new possibilities for interaction. we have this odd burden of standing within the current Internet, which itself has some `decentralized` features.  -- but [lost the thread a little]
    - MZ: I like the term 'affordances' and the evaluation of systems on the basis of their afforances.  how does the system encourage/constrain people, and how does it do so differnetly for different people/groups of people.  And hten also scale: what is the scale of hte system that's operating, but also what is the scale of poewr that an individual i nthe systme wields.  One metaphor I reach for is Gutenberg: you design the printing press, and make it possible to build and run one, that knowledge is now out there; in its first deployment you'll have just a few instances; but the knowledge will spread no matter what.  protocols are a little more complex, though.  b/c they're not just a means of production .  So with e.g. IPFS anyone hsould be able to build their own node.  and htis is how we beat the system, as it were.  

- MP: printing process interesting example: centralizing tendency, is this just the society we live in... what is this?
    - dynamics of markets...?
    - is it intrinsict or what?
    - Mimiograph in the role of the civil rights movement: night printing breaking into work ... believe in some way in the power of these tools to transform social possibilities. But lived through more than one purported revolution that I believed in that didn't happen
    - Condition our enthusiam? Are we being cautioned?
- davidad: the movement of Gutenberg from decentalizing to centrlaizing -- when a new technology is introduced, there is a destabilizing effect, after which there is a restabilizing phase of institutions.
- DW: back to the indivudual: centralization has the effect ocentering a pernicious notion of hte indivudual as autonomous, independent, etc; a just decent requires a different kind of individual.  

- MP: feminist critique from the 1990s, familiar, rehersed in a lot of places... an idea that a lot of patriarchal society imagines a perfectly autonomous individual, society a union of autonomous entities... then the assumption of us grounding our theories on that
    - DW: there are literatures that try to draw on these critiques for concrete design of technical systems. e.g. Lucy Suchman's work on "located accountabilities" of technical production.  in EDGI we are often influenced by these kinds of efforts.  It's hard to get at these questions through just thinking
    - MZ: case study based readings as a way to support a future theme
    - JC: Indieweb (https://indieweb.org/) is a good place to look for this.  
    - JJ: Website extensive wiki with what they want to do, extensive discussion of what they don't want to do
    - JJ: can think about scale (how they've gained users or as it were, sometimes not): https://indieweb.org/generations. A real challenge in outlining goals and still having that hook. Unless you are a certain user that might not be apparent

- DW: flagigng "scale" as a potential future topic.

- MP: I'm not sure we've figured out what accountability might look like... do I really know after reading it. How to design accountability into a system
    - DW: cf. the examples from Schneider: W3C; Internet Archive; Anti-Trust legislation;
    - b5: dangerous propensity to say "let's design an accountability protocol"; note how the working accountability examples are mostly social/political, not technical.
    - but: at the same time, IPFS has tried hard to ubild accountability into the protocol.  Of course we don't yet know how successful that will turn out to be.
    - MZ: in cryptocurrency space, sometimes economic relevant ones; this move lets you dodge the nuance.  There's also this move towards "reputation systems" -- not even clear that decentralized rep systems are even possible. and then also: is Google search centralized? is the IA centralized?  e.g. GOogle search seems to be **decentralizing** for the user's experience. We need to account for that hybridity.  
    - JJ: in response to b5 on protocols: cf. micro.blog -- mostly decentralized; one controbution to its success, was created as kickstarter, and immediately hired a community manager.  And they had that fro mthe get-go.  This human element seems very important.  
- Seong: re: atomized individuals; cf. John Dewey or Bookchin who talk about individualism i na new way - -the new individual as something to replace the classicl liberal abstract being to flip the script, think of hte individual as something being created by society; and Bookchin thinking the same way about individual liberties. Classical liberal, monadic view of individuals can be replaced by more communalistic views of individuals, such as with Dewey's or Bookchin's. One implication of the move away from the individualistic view of social organisation might be a kind of epistemically facilitated accountability, like holoptism replacing the panoptism
    - when we think about p2p, a lot of it has to be about [ drat I lost so much here] . if we try maybe to think about hte networks as prior to the individuals, that might give us a way out of this seeming dead end.   
- EN: contrast the commons as a noun, to the *process of decentralizing or rendering common*.
- DW: let's in the very near future think about what it wil lmean to keep this reading group going as an ongoing project.  CF [the reading group GH repo](https://github.com/datatogether/reading_datatogether)
- MZ: also we talked about asking Marvin to participate -- maybe that will come in the aftermath of this phase of the group.  

### Future Threads

- Affordances, something to take with us and ponder
- Something about scale
- Patterns/cycles of centralization
    - Tim Wu The Master Switch
- What are Accountabilities?
    - Feminist Science Studies
    - Lucy Suchman "Located Accountabilities in Technology Production"
    - Escobar "Design for the Pluriverse" maybe?

15:50:10	 dcwalk: go Matt P. next!  
15:51:26	 Brendan O'Brien: and that range is under-specified!  
15:52:44	 Matt P: dcwalk stop taking notes for me!!!!  
15:54:23	 Brendan O'Brien: it’s even better if it’s *big* data  
15:54:32	 Brendan O'Brien: then people will give you money ;)  
15:54:39	 Matt P::-)  
15:56:01	 dcwalk: I think those were put forward as recommendations (so I think treated at means….?)  
16:00:06	 dcwalk: rico next!  
16:03:44	 dcwalk: I think market cap is like $160 billion?  
16:04:19	 dcwalk: Seong next!  
16:04:59	 dcwalk: social contract ~~~~~~~~~`  
16:05:36	 dcwalk: davidad on stack after  
16:06:18	 Jeremy Cahill: would like to add on the marxian view of capital development after davidad  
16:09:34	 dcwalk: okay! I’ll be on stack after jeremy!  
16:10:42	 Brendan O'Brien: so much! It’s so interesting how many of these “collective” patterns in decentralized context (mining pools, GitHub, coin wallet services) all seem to follow a pattern  
16:11:49	 Eric: For me, key point in Schneider about decentralization/centralization “dialectic” is: “To participate in the decentralization any of these systems offers, one must submit to its protocols…” (p. 23) and the rest of the paragraph  
16:12:13	 Brendan O'Brien: “disrupting”  
16:13:33	 Matt P: my diffculty with that definition is figuring out what "actually achieved" means  
16:14:58	 dcwalk: +1 Matt P., was wrestling with this a little bit today — like how are the forms/goals/outcomes recreated or have similar ones emerging?  
16:18:38	 Brendan O'Brien: yeah if I can jump on stack, that’d be lovely!  
16:18:43	 dcwalk: yr on it!  
16:19:43	 Matt Zumwalt: (matt z jumps on stack)  
16:20:00	 dcwalk: was so excited by the quote too:))  
16:20:39	 dcwalk: the quote: “People come with diverse capacities and opportunities, and recentralization occurs through inequalities of access and power that are external to the system"  
16:21:15	 dcwalk: I felt some serious Data Together vindication on that ;)  
16:21:19	 Jack Jamieson: brb  
16:23:57	 Matt P: I hope we get to come back to the question of assumptions about what 'individuals' are -- the so-called centralized, autonomous self that Schn. talks about.   
16:24:07	 dcwalk: +1 Matt P!  
16:24:16	 davidad: +1  
16:27:54	 dcwalk: Matt P yr on stack!  
16:29:42	 Matt Zumwalt: zines!  
16:31:03	 Matt Zumwalt: davidad rose his hand  
16:31:12	 Matt P: yes zines exactly!  
16:32:17	 Brendan O'Brien: shock doctrinnnne  
16:32:19	 dcwalk: I think The Master switch by Tim Wu has been mentioned in previous groups… maybe that is a future reading/theme?  
16:32:28	 Matt Zumwalt: +1  
16:32:37	 Matt Zumwalt: Master Switch explores this well  
16:32:59	 Matt P: in Kittler's seminar in like 1994 I heard the claim that "eveyr new medium has a revolutionary potential, which lasts jsut for a moment, and is then overturned"  
16:35:50	 Brendan O'Brien: some serious technical/social term intersection going on rn  
16:40:15	 Matt P: hard to hear, can someone fill in?   
16:40:53	 Jeremy Cahill: https://indieweb.org/  
16:41:22	 dcwalk: (jack studies indie web!)  
16:41:34	 Matt P: someone take over for a sec?   
16:43:40	 Matt P: accident right outside, just had t obe sure no one was actively bleeding out!  
16:44:17	 Brendan O'Brien: scale is sooooo interesting  
16:44:23	 Brendan O'Brien: would love to discuss  
16:45:19	 Brendan O'Brien: (b5 joins stack)  
16:45:25	 Matt Zumwalt: (And matt z)  
16:46:11	 Matt P: ethereum?  
16:50:02	 Brendan O'Brien: plz give ur lyft driver 5 starz  
16:51:50	 dcwalk: I have a response to that but Jack go next!  
16:51:57	 Matt P: put me last  
16:52:01	 dcwalk: oh, then Seong—  
16:52:03	 Matt P: I saw seong and eric  
16:52:50	 dcwalk: I’ll type my response: Matt Z… I think it is both (and that is Schneider’s point… decentralizing is a realignment and productive of new centralizations while still decentralized...?)  
16:53:12	 Matt Zumwalt: +!  
16:53:20	 Matt Zumwalt: +1. I need to read it!  
16:53:52	 Matt P: eric too I think.   
16:54:12	 Matt P: I was gonna say that Google though is the prome example of how little centralization is needed in order to create a very high concentration of wealth.   
16:54:34	 dcwalk: ~~we gotta talk about scale~~  
16:54:46	 Eric: woo scale  
16:54:52	 dcwalk: ~~and confederalism and pragmatism~~  
16:56:47	 dcwalk: we could go all the way back to aristotle’s politics on this!  
16:57:11	 Matt Zumwalt: +1 to that as a theme  
16:57:12	 Brendan O'Brien: gotta see I’m just basking in the glow of this discussion  
16:57:14	 Matt P: I'm OK I think.   
16:57:32	 Matt P: lost you eri  
16:58:20	 Eric: sorry y’all!  
16:58:48	 Eric: yep, thanks dcwalk +1  
16:59:28	 Matt P: seong I missed a lont of your last contribution can you add into the notes?  
16:59:51	 Seong: Yep, ok  
16:59:56	 Matt P: thx!  
17:00:15	 davidad: “decentralizing” in politics vs “decentralized” in tech relates (to me) to the tech tendency to write everything in the present tense as if the vision is fait accompli  
17:01:21	 Matt P: ^^ right.  interesting.   
17:02:45	 Brendan O'Brien: could do that on one of our planning calls?  
17:03:30	 Seong: Classical liberal, monadic view of individuals can be replaced by more communalistic views of individuals, such as with Dewey's or Bookchin's. One implication of the move away from the individualistic view of social organisation might be a kind of epistemically facilitated accountability, like holoptism replacing the panoptism  
17:03:50	 Eric: +1 that’s an interesting point, davidad!
