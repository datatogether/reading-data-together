# Data. Together. Let's read about it

## Justice (October 30)

[🎬 **Recorded Call**](https://youtu.be/8w_J6XmjY9g)

### Intro

Why do we care about justice (rather than alternative descriptions of how we ought to act)? Let's explore through popular framings of justice as what is fair as well as social justice (which includes environmental justice, data justice, design justice).

### Themes and Questions

- Mapping theories of change and justice to concrete legal mechanisms
- Mapping connections between these papers and the growing enthusiasm around blockchains and governance via executable contracts
- Contrasting critical studies vs. Rawls vs. Nussbaum
- Getting a handle on the "social" in "social justice"

### Notes
- MHz (Michelle Hertzfeld) volunteers as tribute (note-taker)
- dcwalk: We wanted to talk about Justice because people are interested in and use the vocabulary of social justice, but maybe our understanding wasn't where it could be. This week might be more distant specific technical topic, but we should even talk about that distance.
What might be a good start -- provide a bit of background on the people that we read. Matt P is going to touch on that. Each piece seemed to have something to say to each other, for example.
- Brief reflections first:
 - Matt P: These pieces fall into two categories -- R and N on one hand aim to serve as an intro that guide professional philosophical reflections on justices in the early 20th c. Then, we have the other two, that are engaging in justice for specific kinds of action. What does reconciliation look like, really, and the other brings us back to technology. We could think of our discussion in that way -- frameworks versus how to use them.
 - Kelsey: I was excited to read the Nussbaum piece -- I hadn't seen anyone critique the idea of a social contract in that way before, specifically in the way that people contributing to society being leaches on society. Goes back to the whole concept of building society to mutual advantange, and if you're not contributing equally or in the same way, well then you're not contributing to my society. That's really interesting.
 - Matt Z: I totally viewed the N piece as a dessert, a treat after reading the rest. I always try to read these in the order you assign them because they have a great arc. This was a study in that -- to open up N's piece after reading the others -- totally had this reluctance to buy in to what he was saying. When I first entered into this section of reading, I'd just listened to a podcast -- the Atlantic, interviewing [XXXXXX], justice is what happens after the trauma happens, justice is what happens in order to prevent the trauma happening at all. This was echoing in my head when I read this, and it was kinda perpendicular to the definitions of justice that others used. On the ground people use this term in so many different ways.
 - Rico: Coming to this with the view of building a very technical product that hopes to help this, I liked the [?] comment that justice should begin by starting by looking at communities that are already engaging in these problem areas, and have already been engaging with these difficult problems for a long time. This is really important, and helps make sure you're building something that people actually need, and that includes them. When you find that you're trying to retrofit your product to needs, that's a sign you've skipped this hard work. I like this as a north start for my work.
 - dcwalk: I've read several of these before, but I felt a really big roadblock in reading these works. I find it difficult to return [to this subject area that I was so deep in as an undergraduate].
 - Jeremy:
    1. veil of ignorance: maximin ↔ worst-case runtime analysis. cf average-case runtime analysis with outlier prevention, ensemble methods. jury nullification and other escape-the-system's-wrongness mechanisms seem to suggest that irl implementations aren't concerned with the Correct Theory of Justice and more with self-consistent and predictable schemas for rule enforcement plus escape clauses for edge cases
    2. contractualism and the irrelevance of smart contracts to enforcement lying beyond the means of the system
    3. why shouldn't there be a strong preference in the direction of eliminativist postures about platonic notions that can't be immanentized? what benefit is lost treating the ideal upon which incremental/iterative legal changes are predicated as a useful fiction / "lies-to-children" context clue
    4. hysteresis of legal systems and norms that necessitate rejecting "justice system" in practice (imo)
- dcwalk: Background on the authors --
  - Eve Tuck and K. Wang - her work is explicitly actionist, works with youth and theorizes decolonization. This line in their intro characterizes their approach to Critical Ethnic Studies:
   > The work of critical ethnic studies is far larger than our own particularities, and is taking off across activist intellectual spaces that include extra-academic and academic settings, anywhere that foments an open dialogue that brings together “Indigenous sovereignty, critiques of antiblackness, intersectional feminist and queer analyses, disability studies, border and migration studies, critical refugee studies, and more,”
  - Diana Nucera - has focused on community forms of research. This isn't written in an academic way, they do large-scale research projects but are very concerned with writing this with and for communities. That article is a synthesis of a community-driven process for digital justice. In parallel, there are design justice principles the developed in the same community. That articulation spawned other ways of using that language of justice to guide organizing work, and people have been carrying that forward in similar but slightly different contexts.
- Matt P: Rawls and Nussbaum are two of the most influential philosophers of their time in this domain. N became a philosopher in moral philosophy later. Their work is around the way this type of philosophy pivots in the late 20th century. Any analytic philosopher who believes in liberal democracy has to engage with their work. 
  - In their work, we see how the concept of justice becomes much more difficult to understand as you get into it. You feel it slipping away as you read Rawls. You get to understand the idea of this founding myth of the veil of mist, analogous to Plato's cave, it's this movie or feeling of a misty veil. This is important in philosophical discussion in the next 40 years. It comes from a lineage contract theories -- like Hobbs, there was a *real* contract once, on which our society was founded. This -- we should use this contract scenario to understand the bounds of a just society, even though it is not a real thing.
  - N: Before the end of the 20th c. she was a famous classicist. The philosophical idea she puts forward was first articulated by Armatya Sen. N's is contract theory but against utilitarianism. The capabilities approach is also anti-utilitarian. These are two frameworks. Caricatured position that had become dominant. Tried to understand a just society based on the real capacity that that society affords to the citizens who live in that society. Takes issue with Rawls largely around how that view depends on fundamental equality of capacity. Tries to take into account the reality of difference, in a serious way.
 - Nussbaum on the consequences of considering her 3 problems: 
    > I hope to show that the type of difficulty we shall encounter cannot be handled by merely applying the old theoretical structure to the new case; it is built into the theoreti- cal structure itself, in such a way as to lead us to search for a different type of theoretical structure, albeit one in which major elements in Rawls’s theory will survive and provide valuable guidance. (Nussbaum 2007, Frontiers of Justice, 6)
- Matt Z: Clearly that book is framed around disability, also species membership. Does she also in other works apply this to other areas?
- Matt P: Yeah, totally. So -- capabilities are related to economics. So, cababilities are beings and doings, the two classifications. you can be comfortable in your house, or you can vote. These are capabilities. A 'be' and a 'do'. Sen startsa question of how you have a functioning economic system that also provides some measure of justice -- so economics is actually at the heart of the undertaking.
Wrote a prior book on sexuality and justice. She's really interested - beginsa feminist position, about equality, fairness, & justice of distribution of capabilities between men and women in a just society
- dcwalk: This is meaty enough to get going in our topic areas, I think. I want to recall one thing Jeremy said at the top, and feels like a big node, so not sure how to handle it. It's this moving into practive these abstract theories. How do you apply, or imagine, something that's put forward behind a veil of ignorance, sort of Rawlsian idea -- I want to pull up a quote the Nucera article -- Two Way Streets
    > In our line of work, it’s often much easier to debate the nature of problems than to embody their solutions. “Assembling a real group of people is so much harder and more powerful than a rhetorical understanding of the public,” Rich explains. “It is in the assembly of these people that you learn what it takes to gather input, and what ideas people are attached to.” But that’s when the real work begins. “It is less about having faith in good ideas, and more about how we can create a philosophy between the government and the people. There are benefits beyond achieving the objective when we do things together.”
  - There's this divide between the theoretical and the practical (or, theorists & practitioners)– how do you engage with that divide?
  - In the four points, Jeremy, you mentioned -- there are some deep engagement with Rawls. This could be a good start if people want to dig into that. I also, this is moreN, want to think about how social contract theory is a semi-unconcious backdrop to the way we talk and think about everything. We metaphorically rely on the social contract.
  - Is there anything else we want to talk about?
- Matt Z: This idea of social contracts, and all the enthusiasm around smart contracts.
- Matt P: yeah, can we talk a little bit about Rawls' contract. There's something that feels kind of inevitable about the extreme abstraction in Rawls' framing of this problem. He wants there to be – there's a forced virtue. It's the thing that matters before everything else matters. Other people ahve tried to do that, there have been problems. He things he can get around it. Abstracting more and more. The problem with SC theory is that it's about particular societies. Ir order to do that, you have to abstract the notion of the contractees, the people engaged in the contract. The become less and less person-like. The people that are contracting, behind the veil of ignorance, not only don't they have sexc or class, they also don't have proclivities, preferences. If they did, they couldn't make the right call about society.
  - While all of this can seem extremely remote, to me, it shows a weakness in the idea of justice as a governing principle. This feels like something Tuck was after in that small piece, where they say justice can become like a hegemonic force in the way we think about organizing activism, and maybe that's a problem.
  - In any case, this seems to be a problem in Rawls. The people he's talking about are no longer people. You have these rays making decisions about the world we should live in.
- Matt Z: One of my strategies for contiuing to read Rawls was -- ok, there are come sci fi novels that set up this idea of having artificially figured out a form of just society, and tricked humans into acting this way -- if you read this whole thing as a stab at designing this system, this AI. The only way this could happen is having something that's not human interpreting it. otherwise, i kept coming back to, how is this helpful if you can't land it?
- Matt P: I'll take the other side here. The point is -- the way to understand what *is* a just society is to have a framework, and this is it. And since I don't know how I'm going to be in this world, I want the worst-off people to be in the best-possible position. So, you can apply this principle to a policy choice -- which version of the legislation should I go with? I wanna go with the maxi-min version.
- dcwalk: I'm also going to try to make an argument for the abstraction, which also rubs me the wrong way. How I was taught about R was that it was a response to the current ideas about SC theory, and how it was insufficient. I think the most striking one was the Hobbs version. He gave a different formation myth -- how we got to be where we are in society -- solitary, nasty, butish, and short -- and used this to justify a soveriegn that's coersive, because that's better than the alternative. So, in order to speak to another side, Rawls puts this forth, and also is a more hopeful take on people.
  - A lot of the other philosophers in this space really had a model of how people would act around each other that this was really against. This is really in comparision to the other ways justice was being talked about. it did some work. It does that through a very universilizing notion of equality that have been critiques of. Hey, if we startthis notion -- equality versus equity -- there are lots of groups that aren't startingthe same place as cis white people due to historic disadvantages.
  - I kinda feel like there's a way that Tuck and Yang are a response, or a conversation, with ....colonial temporality.
- Jeremy: My huge, completely open bias towards, pretty much open content towards any moral or legal posturing that doesn't have skin in the game in the sense a philopher proscribing a way forward, or like a supreme court justice writing a dissenting opinion that's more about their personal notions about the text they're supposed to be interpreting.
  - So, I tend to not care about the limits of each system, I don't see a need to have the Correct Theory of X in a case where there can't be a perfect, universalist system. It seems like the more practical concerns have little to do with whether the thing is self-contained. We're talking about things where we know that we need a certain framework at certain times, and another at other times. You need a model zoo. Whether you feel like it's dehumanizing to give up the human-nature part of the model -- someone else will do it. There's going to be a pressure to model people as little game pieces, whether you want to participate or not. Questioning the validity of that approach isn't helpful.
  - Your best alternative to negotiated agreement is not to give up the sense of trying to have a better model, or a more applicable model, it's to posit there is a better model in this particular context.
- dcwalk: Can I say it back to you, in my words? The role of theory or theorizing, and conditions in the world, or bringing things into the world, leaving out bad things. I think what you're treating as a model, I would say theory. If Rawls is providing this theory, but doesn't provide how people in actual conditions get into it or out of it, ... I would offer another piece to that, I think sometimes having a model of a thing is helpful to understand what's going on in the world.
- Jeremy: The way that I would characterize my distinction -- a theory of change is a useful thing to think about -- that is a thing that *you* are trying to put forth and do. In contrast, theories of justice, you're talking about someone else in some far-away land, you have to pre-suppose some universals, how do you know how poeple in Ghana believe certain things about justice. If you have theory of change, you're figuring out how to do it. A theory of justice, that seems -- almost non-sensical.
- dcwalk: Can I invite Eric to talk about what you just put in the chat?
- Eric: This was just one of the quotes the Tuck and Yang aritcle
    > “Beyond justice, there are terms that articulate their theories of change…Each approach is born of specific material concerns that refuse the abstraction of justice and its limits in the nation-state.”
  - When I got to this point, this is when I could really latch on to their argument against justice, or the limits of justice, and how alternatives to justice are being operationlized and how they might be. This is a striking, central paragraph for me.
- dcwalk: Here, also, are some of the theories of change they mention:
  > rematriation, reparations, regeneration, sovereignty, self-determination, de-colonization, resurgence, the good life, futurisms.
- Eric: To expand a little more -- something we havne't talked about much is the temporality of justice. Justice is something that is posited into the future, but there are limits to that. And the inherent story arc -- where you start with the injustice, and move towards the justice. This was interesting to me -- Tuck talks about the damage-oriented approach to research and justice.
- dcwalk: To add to the temporality -- the ways that justice gets delayed, or pushed to the future, and the way the state has asserted a monopoly on justice. I read this as a probing on how justice has operated.
- Jeremy: I just really struggle -- a lot of the alternative approaches, taking into account the different identify groups, identify norms, they seem to be, they read to me in this concern-trolling sort of way. It's hard for me to see anyone benefitingthe attempt to coin new neologisms -- anything that is de-coupledchanges to the basic social substrate that created those issues. Being told that there's a racial bias in the way that justice is carried out in this country, what good does that do unless there are suggestions on ways to improve this?
- Matt P: Yeah, there's something frustrating around theories that end up making careers for people without changing the system. I don't feel that way about this piece. Maybe it helps to be in Canada, and be closer to a truth and reconcilitation process. Let's step back a moment, and ask what does a truth and reconciliation and justice look like to indigenious people in Canada. It's a 200-year process where a process pretended to care, but instead committed genocide [MHz note: I didn't catch the better way that was articulated -- Matt P may want to fix]. So, that doesn't feel that abstract -- when we talk about justice, indigenous people know that there is no fairness. We will continue to ask for it, but that's not because we think we will get it. So, this is a reflection of the practical struggles of people -- how are we supposed to proceed with this concept of justice that has basically only been a burden for us, what can we wrestthat process?
- dcwalk: Maybe I'll say one piece on there -- it makes a cautionary point, taking up this name of justice for a radical agenda, if we're using 'justice' as a bannar to get to change things, what does that *do* to justice? What are the ways that this tool of justice has been used and recycled?
- Seong: I felt a pretty strong connection between the first reading and the Nussbaum one. Primarily because the first one -- the argument that justice is necessarily defined by the state, and the state articulates the bounds, so justice is not timeless nor universal state of things that can ever be achieved within the bounds of the state. This related to these ideas and arms of the states aren't reprentational of anything -- they're machines that respond to people's ideas of what justice is, whether or not justice actually exists. So, they are by nature leaving out the people who are left out because they're not able to be a part of these systems.
  - I think they're getting at this obscure prospective, but their point about -- the person that takes it...-- derives their power when you get to make exceptions to the rules. Because the state gets to decide when to make the exception, they can also decide who is excludednotions of justice. So, I think that's the connection between the two readings. [Seong -- I you may want to edit what I wrote -- you said it better ^.^]
- dcwalk: That's a really great framing, thank you!
- Matt Z: I actually just wanted to hear more about connections between the readings.
- Matt P: [DRAMATIC PAUSE] The notion of justice as a concept that puts everyone on the same footing. What they both say is...the same footing is an illusion, and its a pernicious illusion that allows people to be further hurt, allows existing marginalization to be intensified. Much of the time, you're instead stregnthening the markers that divides society into insiders and outsiders. I feel like the place that N most obviously addresses T&Y is the relationship of justice to the state.
  - If we're able to imagine the social in social justice to extend beyond the borders of the state, and we try to do that -- think of the anti-globalization movement, the notion that we should all be bound by the same rules. The idea isn't who is the best and worse of than people in France, but the idea of what we do in the US impacts people everywhere. N destabilizes the state as the extent of justice. 
  - The place where no analytic philosophy is gonna help you is the relationship between justice and trauma, and grief. You look at Black Lives Matter, and I think it was true in the civil rights movement, that grief was a foundational part of the movement. It's an action undertaken to change social conditions, but also a way to manage the uncurable pain of injustice. I don't think any account of justice that lays out a set of logical arguments is going to get you to what T&Y are trying to express with that.
- dcwalk: I'll say one super-brief thing here, which is I don't think so, either. I think the analytic force of philosophy does not have the emotional/affective resonance  -- even if they try to address this. Though Martha N wrote a book called "Political Emotion", so maybe we should read it. 
  - We have 10 minutes left, maybe we want to arrive at technology. My attempt to go and get us there is re-drawing the string that Matt Z put out about smart contracts, and the one thing I mentioned at the beginning that N points to really effectively is the way of using a SC is implicit in the way we talk about how people are part of society. I would say the way we talk about decentralization, the idea of a contract seems prevalent.
- Matt Z: In the blockchain space, it's not only that, it's a reductive view of contracts. Even at its most extreme, the best of the best of abstracted attempts at getting nuance in contracts still feel inadequate, even if you're extremely generous and imagine at decentralization at its most refined, will it grapple with things that is better than what we have now? I am worried about the future of this because the conversation is so reductive.
- dcwalk: Yeah, I think what Diana's work does, is a description of how you would incorporate justice in tech. It's a process thing, rather than describing an outcome. There's a lot that I get really stuck on -- about how do we grapple with the intended values in technology, and then the unintended ones, whether it's blockchain or not.
- Jeremy: There's a hole that is easy to fall down when a new technology looks like it will be a general drop-in substitute for something that couldn't be automated before -- something that could be made an oracle. For example, a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), the discussion becomes 'can the DAO do all the things that I can do now with my current system' instead of 'how does it change, or how can it augment'.
- dcwalk: We only have 3 minutes, and this is our last chat, wow! In the moments we have left, does anyone who hasn't said anything want to add.
- Kelsey: I've been thinking a lot about what you said earlier, Matt P, about how these were theories about people without proclivities, and I've been reading a lot about meditation lately, and the idea of having no preference in those readings. Then, this becomes a flipped way to look at all of this. [Blows everyones' minds]
- Matt P: What does it take to get to to building just technologies? Some of the answer isn't so complicated, it's paying attention to people. It's just that so many of us are so bad at it. I wanted to hear more about it.
- dcwalk: I think we should talk more about it at another meeting. There are so many touchstones in this space

### Future Directions

- Retrospective end November!
- Set up Zotero group

### Chat Log

00:08:17	dcwalk: https://hackmd.io/oEcuKALCTi-PbawLmT_Ixw?edit  
00:10:27	Matt Price:	yes but we should be brief.  
00:13:24	dcwalk: Rico next!  
00:14:30	dcwalk: maybe an unfair priming effect on my part  
00:15:37	Matt Price:	The tension between justice as retribution and justice as distribution is clear there.  
00:16:07	Matt Price:	justice as a redress or balance is at the heart of a lot of philosophy and legal theory before rawls.   
00:18:24	Jeremy Cahill:	i'm not sure what to do with these points but here are things that come to mind for me <moved above>  
00:19:28	Michelle Hertzfeld:	[copied to notepad! :D ]     
00:19:48	Matt Price:	thx for the heroic notetaking mHz. thought I was gonna be helping but... :-(  
00:26:58	dcwalk: that feels similar to a lot of philosophy :((  
00:28:34	dcwalk: Also his “state of nature” is functioning in a similar way to the “original position"  
00:32:31	Jeremy Cahill:	maybe tangentially related to the "unholy" confluence description from - Matt P: the recent discussion around this newyorker article https://www.google.com/search?q=can+economists+and+humanists+ever+be+friends  
00:34:41	Matt Price:	fumbling shows some of hte limits of my knowledge here!  
00:39:09	dcwalk: Let’s start here and try and weave in jeremy’s thoughts?  
00:41:42	dcwalk: that quote: “justice” is one of those stalwart terms that can come to quickly dominate the terms of the radical agenda.”  
00:42:56	Matt Price:	Foundation  
00:42:57	dcwalk: tell us which ones!!!  
00:43:06	Matt Price:	well, Second Foundation  
00:45:34	Matt Zumwalt:	Yeah - Asimov explores the idea from a bunch of different angles.  
00:46:48	Matt Price:	the other really pernicious hting he's working against is utilitarianism.  
00:47:32	Matt Price:	both a Hayek-like individualism AND the horrible fairness-free formulation of utilitarianism as the "greatest good for the greatest number"  
00:49:36	Matt Price:	I find it interesting to think about how and whether Nussbaum alleviates Tuck & Yang's criticisms of the justice concept.   
00:49:46	Matt Price:	in particular, she wants to take the state out of the notion of justice.  
00:50:10	dcwalk: - Matt P: I was really stuck thinking on that too!  
00:50:20	Matt Zumwalt:	+1 I’d like to hear people’s thoughts on that.  
00:53:57	Matt Price:	Disagreeing (I think): I think we learn from the defects of the model. And what I think we learn is that "justice" as conceptualized in philosophy and also in our gut feeling of indignation, isn't somethingwe understand very well. So it's useful to spend a little bit of time asking what we mean.  
00:56:36	Matt Price:	And then at the same time these conceptions of ustice can help guide our actions. So, for instane: seeing what's wrong w/ Rawls, an tyringo ut capability approaches, suggests that when we design technology to alleviate injustice we need to ask "what new capability does this tool give to those whose capabilities are most limited by hte current organization of society?" And in the most concrete and practical way.   
00:56:54	Eric:	Would link this point Jeremy makes about justice and abstraction to Tuck and Yang: “Beyond justice, there are terms that articulate their theories of change…Each approach is born of specific material concerns that refuse the abstraction of justice and its limits in the nation-state.”  
00:57:36	dcwalk: Totally fine!  
00:58:53	dcwalk: the theories of change they mention: rematriation, reparations, regeneration, sovereignty, self-determination, de-colonization, resurgence, the good life, futurisms.  
01:00:20	Matt Price:	"the arc of the moral universe is long..."  
01:00:31	Jeremy Cahill:	my beef there is more about the overwhelming sense of bullshit i get from lit that says things like "Justice is a colonial temporality". Why not Time is a Flat Circle? Do either of those claims undo a transgression or lead toward models that prescribe commensurate societal response to said transgression?  
01:01:03	Jeremy Cahill:	wordplay doesn't unkill people  
01:03:23	dcwalk: Matt P. next?  
01:03:30	Matt Price:	k  
01:04:34	Jeremy Cahill:	<3  
01:05:37	Kelsey Breseman:	…after pretending non-existence, yeah?  
01:07:36	Jeremy Cahill:	concrete example of current effects that comes to mind for me would be the crazy-high % of violent crimes (incl sex crimes) committed by non-indigenous perpetrators   
01:08:58	dcwalk: Let’s not forget this connection!  
01:09:07	dcwalk: Yeaaaaah glad you brought that up.  
01:10:08	Matt Price:	dude, that was a blast form the past! desiring machines!  
01:10:17	dcwalk: :))  
01:11:08	Jeremy Cahill:	- Matt P: has there been empirical influence of social justice discourse from the intelligentsia on law enforcement policy, legal norms, etc in canadian handling of indigenous rights? cet par or vs. militantly action-oriented approaches to the same topics  
01:11:15	Matt Price:	also "opportunities" that the system provides for people who cannot, as a matter of fact and circumstance, make use of them.  
01:11:43	Matt Price:	I find it absolutely useful as a sort of rule-of-thumb assessment of government policies.  
01:11:49	Matt Price:	capability theory, I mean.  
01:12:33	Matt Price:	We need to get to technology I think!!  
01:14:18	Matt Price:	I talk so damn much  
01:14:27	Matt Zumwalt:	seeing hit a lot of it.  
01:14:31	Matt Zumwalt:	seong  
01:14:39	Jeremy Cahill:	i don't want to totally beat dead horse about having really pessimistic views of talk-as-talk vs. talk-as-tasksetting  
01:17:53	dcwalk: RE: anti-globalization efforts.. and then look at how they practice justice? (e.g., restorative justice)  
01:20:04	Matt Price:	@jeremy :-) but I am not sure I believe in the opposition exactly!  
01:20:24	Matt Price:	there are some awesome accounts of political sentiment.  
01:20:54	Matt Price:	Adam Smith's Theory of Moral Sentiments is so interesting. And also the book that he thought was his really important work (not Wealth of Nations)  
01:21:08	Matt Zumwalt:	+1  
01:21:42	Matt Price:	it has to be right?  
01:22:20	Matt Price:	I mean... it's mechanistic. It's automating the mechanistic vision of what a contract does.  
01:23:19	Matt Price:	I know so little about blockchain. But the view of what society is, and what people are, that bitcoin seems to have, is, from what I can see, kind of abhorrent.  
01:24:03	dcwalk: maybe “social contract” theories?  
01:24:55	Jeremy Cahill:	what about reasoning about DAOs  
01:25:54	Matt Price:	wait I got distracted what are DAOs?  
01:26:05	dcwalk: Decentralized Autonomous Organizations  
01:26:13	Matt Price:	ah :-)  
01:26:41	dcwalk: also the DAO is the big etherium one. I think (?) only a smart-contract blockchain phenomena  
01:27:04	dcwalk: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)  
01:28:03	Jeremy Cahill:	ah sorry yeah  
01:28:48	Matt Price:	this makes me think about the economics work from I think the1920's about the social foundaitons of the free market. Hayek thinks markets organize free societies when left to their own devices. But these "free" markets only come into being as a result of heavy government intervention. The DAO's are maybe kinda like that.  
01:29:24	Matt Price:	Matt Z is the one to respond to this!  
01:29:25	Matt Zumwalt:	“equanimity”  
01:29:37	Jeremy Cahill:	so the intended gist there, matt p, was that enthusiasm for automating the mechanisms of a ruleset being very strongly associated with lack of considered thought about what happens when someone steps outside the system  
01:29:55	dcwalk: I’ve also struggled,  
01:30:11	dcwalk: but also notion of “dispassion” that filter thru  
01:31:24	Matt Zumwalt:	It’s important to keep in mind that equanimity is the fourth of the Four Immeasurables. To get to equanimity, you first have to cultivate profound Loving Kindness, Compassion, and Joy (seeing and rejoicing in the positive qualities inherent in all beings)  
01:31:25	Eric:	“Place-based design” is a term Nucera used that resonated with me, and gets to this larger issue about not being able to separate justice from context  
01:32:25	Matt Price:	@jeremy yeah and the enthusiasm for DAO then either (a) just totally misunderstands its own weakness or (b) is gonna require a whole new enforcement apparatus rooted in perhaps new or maybe old forms of inequity.   
01:32:26	Matt Zumwalt:	and Equanimity only makes sense in that context — seeing that those positive qualities (and the desire to be happy, and the desire to avoid suffering) is the fundamentally the same in everyone  
01:32:27	Jeremy Cahill:	did the protocol labs general counsel planning pan out?  
01:33:08	Matt Price:	oh, Matt Z, the teachings here! that is actually so helpful.  
01:33:43	Kelsey Breseman:	would love to read about historical attempts at redress for these huge (racial, indigenous, etc.) interventions through esp. policy  
01:33:59	Matt Price:	and then eric, also, i appreciate the reminder of that part of the article.  
01:34:39	Jeremy Cahill:	anytime idea: a project teardown as a "reading", maybe  
01:34:58	Matt Price:	@kelsey the coolest thing would be if there is a piece that goes through some specific attempt at redress and carefully asks, what were people trying to do here, and what did they do right, and what kinds of mistakes did they make?
